         with DUPIXENT.         

1286
00:46:01,224 --> 00:46:02,456
 DUPIXENT is the first treatment

1287
00:46:02,725 --> 00:46:04,125
  of its kind that continuously 

1288
00:46:04,427 --> 00:46:05,826
   treats                       
   moderate-to-severe eczema,   

1289
00:46:06,062 --> 00:46:07,962
   or atopic dermatitis,        

1290
00:46:08,231 --> 00:46:09,497
   even between flare ups.      

1291
00:46:10,199 --> 00:46:11,699
   DUPIXENT is a biologic,      

1292
00:46:11,968 --> 00:46:13,734
   and not a cream or steroid.  

1293
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:15,870
   Many people taking DUPIXENT  

1294
00:46:16,139 --> 00:46:18,005
 saw clear or almost clear skin.

1295
00:46:18,608 --> 00:46:20,808
    And, had                    
    significantly less itch.    

1296
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:22,910
       That's a difference      
          you can feel.         

1297
00:46:23,246 --> 00:46:25,046
       Don't use if you're      
      allergic to DUPIXENT.     

1298
00:46:25,381 --> 00:46:26,981
        Serious allergic        
      reactions can occur,      

1299
00:46:27,283 --> 00:46:29,216
     including anaphylaxis,     
        which is severe.        

1300
00:46:29,452 --> 00:46:30,084
     Tell your doctor about     

1301
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,019
 new or worsening eye problems, 

1302
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:33,788
        such as eye pain        
       or vision changes,       

1303
00:46:34,057 --> 00:46:35,356
    or a parasitic infection.

00:46:35,625 --> 00:46:36,624
  If you take asthma medicines, 

1305
00:46:36,893 --> 00:46:37,958
    don't change or stop them   

1306
00:46:38,261 --> 00:46:39,327
 without talking to your doctor.

00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:42,296
          So help heal          
     your skin from within,     

1308
00:46:42,665 --> 00:46:45,633
     And talk to your eczema    
   specialist about DUPIXENT.
