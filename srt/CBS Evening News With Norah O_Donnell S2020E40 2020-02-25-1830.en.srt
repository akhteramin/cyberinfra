HIV medicine is one part of it. 

598
00:16:32,056 --> 00:16:33,823
      Prescription DOVATO       
         is for adults          

599
00:16:33,825 --> 00:16:35,591
who are starting HIV-1 treatment

600
00:16:35,593 --> 00:16:36,993
         and who aren't

601
00:16:36,995 --> 00:16:38,661
        of the medicines        
  dolutegravir or lamivudine.   

602
00:16:38,663 --> 00:16:39,862
        DOVATO has 2...         

603
00:16:39,864 --> 00:16:41,130
        medicines in...         

604
00:16:41,132 --> 00:16:43,799
    1 pill to help you reach    
  and then stay undetectable.   

605
00:16:43,801 --> 00:16:46,535
 So your HIV can be controlled  
    with fewer medicines...     

606
00:16:46,537 --> 00:16:47,903
      while taking DOVATO.      

607
00:16:47,905 --> 00:16:49,105
      You can take DOVATO       
       anytime of day,...       

608
00:16:49,107 --> 00:16:50,406
          with food...          

609
00:16:50,408 --> 00:16:51,674
          or without.           

610
00:16:51,676 --> 00:16:53,676
      Don't take DOVATO if      
you're allergic to any of its...

611
00:16:53,678 --> 00:16:55,878
     ingredients or if you      
        take dofetilide.        

612
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,313
    If you have hepatitis B,    

613
00:16:57,315 --> 00:16:59,148
      it can change during      
     treatment with DOVATO      

614
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,716
           and become           
        harder to treat.        

615
00:17:00,718 --> 00:17:03,385
 Your hepatitis B may get worse 
 or become life-threatening...  

616
00:17:03,387 --> 00:17:06,088
   if you stop taking DOVATO.   
    So do not stop DOVATO...    

617
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:07,823
without talking to your doctor. 

618
00:17:07,825 --> 00:17:10,726
Serious side effects can occur, 
including allergic reactions,...

619
00:17:10,728 --> 00:17:12,695
        liver problems,         
       and liver failure.       

620
00:17:12,697 --> 00:17:15,131
 Life-threatening side effects  
  include lactic acid buildup   

621
00:17:15,133 --> 00:17:16,365
   and severe liver problems.   

622
00:17:16,367 --> 00:17:17,600
       If you have a rash       

623
00:17:17,602 --> 00:17:19,235
       and other symptoms       
  of an allergic reaction,...   

624
00:17:19,237 --> 00:17:22,037
   stop taking DOVATO and get   
    medical help right away.    

625
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:24,073
  Tell your doctor if you have  
  kidney or liver problems,...  

626
00:17:24,075 --> 00:17:25,674
  including hepatitis B or C.   

627
00:17:26,244 --> 00:17:27,877
One of the ingredients in DOVATO
        may harm your...        

628
00:17:27,879 --> 00:17:29,111
          unborn baby.          

629
00:17:29,113 --> 00:17:30,579
   Your doctor may prescribe    
    a different medicine...     

630
00:17:30,581 --> 00:17:32,681
than DOVATO. Your doctor should 
     do a pregnancy test...     

631
00:17:32,683 --> 00:17:33,916
       before starting...       

632
00:17:33,918 --> 00:17:35,851
     DOVATO. Use effective      
        birth control...        

633
00:17:35,853 --> 00:17:37,253
      while taking DOVATO.      

634
00:17:37,255 --> 00:17:40,022
  The most common side effects  
are headache, diarrhea, nausea, 

635
00:17:40,024 --> 00:17:42,124
trouble sleeping, and tiredness.

636

CHARLESTON: THE COFFEE SHOP WITH
A STAFF THAT KNOWS ALL ABOUT    

699
00:20:31,762 --> 00:20:34,730
A STAFF THAT KNOWS ALL ABOUT    
OVERCOMING OBSTACLES.           

700
00:20:38,201 --> 00:20:39,735
   I knew about the tremors.    

701
00:20:40,337 --> 00:20:42,304
       But when I started       
         seeing things,         

702
00:20:42,306 --> 00:20:44,239
         I didn't know          
     what was happening...      

703
00:20:44,241 --> 00:20:45,640
        so I kept it in.        

704
00:20:45,642 --> 00:20:47,976

       that weren't true.       

705
00:20:48,545 --> 00:20:50,112
 I knew something was wrong...  

706
00:20:50,114 --> 00:20:51,680
    but I didn't say a word.    

707
00:20:51,682 --> 00:20:53,248
       During the course        
        of their disease        

708
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,350
      around 50% of people      
        with Parkinson's        

709
00:20:55,352 --> 00:20:58,286
 may experience hallucinations  
         or delusions.          

710
00:20:58,288 --> 00:21:00,922
But now, doctors are prescribing
           NUPLAZID.            

711
00:21:00,924 --> 00:21:02,791
          The only FDA          
      approved medicine...      

712
00:21:02,793 --> 00:21:04,292
 proven to significantly reduce 

713
00:21:04,294 --> 00:21:07,329
  hallucinations and delusions  
    related to Parkinson's.     

714
00:21:07,331 --> 00:21:10,332
   Don't take NUPLAZID if you   
are allergic to its ingredients.

715
00:21:10,334 --> 00:21:12,134
 NUPLAZID can increase the risk 
            of death            

716
00:21:12,136 --> 00:21:14,669
       in elderly people        
with dementia-related psychosis 

717
00:21:14,671 --> 00:21:16,104
and is not for treating symptoms

718
00:21:16,106 --> 00:21:18,240
          unrelated to          
      Parkinson's disease.      

719
00:21:18,242 --> 00:21:20,242
   NUPLAZID can cause changes   
        in heart rhythm         

720
00:21:20,244 --> 00:21:21,910
    and should not be taken     
      if you have certain       

721
00:21:21,912 --> 00:21:23,545
     abnormal heart rhythms     
      or take other drugs       

722
00:21:23,547 --> 00:21:24,779
that are known to cause changes 

723
00:21:24,781 --> 00:21:26,014
        in heart rhythm.        

724
00:21:26,016 --> 00:21:27,516
        Tell your doctor        
       about any changes        

725
00:21:27,518 --> 00:21:28,783
  in medicines you're taking.   

726
00:21:28,785 --> 00:21:30,051
The most common side effects are

727
00:21:30,053 --> 00:21:32,187
 swelling of the arms and legs  
         and confusion.         

728
00:21:32,189 --> 00:21:34,823
    We spoke up and it made     
      all the difference.       

729
00:21:34,825 --> 00:21:36,625
Ask your Parkinson's specialist 

730
00:21:36,627 --> 00:21:37,826
        about NUPLAZID.

     and construction firm.     

950
00:29:08,143 --> 00:29:10,377
Before Mike, we were desperate. 

951
00:29:10,412 --> 00:29:11,111
      There were not a lot      

952
00:29:11,146 --> 00:29:12,246
      of opportunities for      

953
00:29:12,281 --> 00:29:13,413
     black-owned businesses     

954
00:29:13,449 --> 00:29:14,882
          to compete.           

955
00:29:14,917 --> 00:29:16,650
  Mike saw that and he leveled  

956
00:29:16,685 --> 00:29:17,885
     the playing field for      

957
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,720
    black-owned businesses.     

958
00:29:19,755 --> 00:29:20,988
    Over the years, we have     

959
00:29:21,023 --> 00:29:22,489
      heard a lot of talk.      

960
00:29:22,524 --> 00:29:23,790
    But Mike came in, and he    

961
00:29:23,826 --> 00:29:26,560
actually did something about it.

962
00:29:26,595 --> 00:29:27,628
  And that's how Mike will get  

963
00:29:27,663 --> 00:29:28,929
     it done as president.      

964

         this message.          

967

 We live in a country of shared 
            dreams.             

968
00:29:37,773 --> 00:29:39,339

             from.              

969

             skin.              

970
00:29:40,943 --> 00:29:42,309
    No matter who you love.     

971
00:29:42,378 --> 00:29:46,013
  That you can make it in the   
   United States of America.    

972
00:29:46,081 --> 00:29:48,448
  So I stand before you today   

973
00:29:48,517 --> 00:29:50,651
 as the grandaughter of an iron 
           ore miner.           

974
00:29:50,719 --> 00:29:53,220
As the daughter of a teacher and
        a newspaperman.         

975
00:29:53,288 --> 00:29:57,391
 As the first woman elected to  
 the U.S. Senate from the state 
         of Minnesota.          

976
00:29:57,459 --> 00:30:00,526
And a candidate for president of
       the United States.
