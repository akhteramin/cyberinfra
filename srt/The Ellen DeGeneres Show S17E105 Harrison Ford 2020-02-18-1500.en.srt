  When your psoriasis is bad,   

553
00:22:31,408 --> 00:22:33,408
      it can be hard to

554
00:22:33,476 --> 00:22:38,146
    But the possibilities       
    become clear with Taltz     

555
00:22:38,215 --> 00:22:39,848
     the first and only

       offering a chance

      at 100% clear skin.       

558
00:22:42,953 --> 00:22:44,486
With Taltz,                     
up to 90%                       

559
00:22:44,554 --> 00:22:46,554
of those with

saw a significant               
improvement                     

561
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:49,491

plaques.                        

562
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:51,793
Some even saw                   
100% clear skin.                

563
00:22:51,862 --> 00:22:54,262
Don't use if you're             
allergic to Taltz.              

564
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,798
Before starting,                
get checked for                 
tuberculosis.                   

565
00:22:56,867 --> 00:22:58,233
Increased risk                  
of infections                   

566
00:22:58,302 --> 00:23:00,535
           and lower ability to 
           fight them may occur.

567
00:23:00,604 --> 00:23:02,871
Tell your doctor about          
infections, symptoms,           

568
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,907
or if inflammatory bowel disease
symptoms develop, worsen        

569
00:23:05,976 --> 00:23:08,143
      or if you've had a        
      vaccine or plan to.       

570
00:23:08,212 --> 00:23:10,412
Serious allergic                
reactions can occur.            

571
00:23:10,481 --> 00:23:11,980
     See the possibilities.     

572
00:23:12,049 --> 00:23:14,016
  Ask your doctor about Taltz.  

573
00:23:31,935 --> 00:23:32,868
      I remember thinking,      

574
00:23:32,904 --> 00:23:34,103
  'please God, I hope I don't   

575
00:23:34,138 --> 00:23:36,806
     meet the Mayor today.'     

576
00:23:36,841 --> 00:23:38,874
 And in walked Mayor Bloomberg. 

577
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:41,410
       Soon as I saw him,       

578
00:23:41,446 --> 00:23:44,580
    I knew what that meant.     

579
00:23:44,615 --> 00:23:46,515
 I'm Margaret Brick, and my son 

580
00:23:46,551 --> 00:23:48,084
      Tommy Brick was the       

581
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:49,485
 first firefighter to be killed 

582
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,622
     in a fire after 9/11.      

583
00:23:52,657 --> 00:23:54,423
    I said what is going to     

584
00:23:54,459 --> 00:23:56,959
    happen to his children?     

585
00:23:56,995 --> 00:23:58,294
 Without even skipping a beat,  

586
00:23:58,329 --> 00:24:00,129
        Mike said to me,        

587
00:24:00,165 --> 00:24:02,065
 'the fire department will take 

588
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,733
    good care of those kids,    

589
00:24:03,768 --> 00:24:04,934
       but if they don't,       

590
00:24:04,969 --> 00:24:07,036
     I will do it myself.'      

591
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:08,638

594
00:24:13,245 --> 00:24:14,377
 to just say I want you to know 

595
00:24:14,412 --> 00:24:15,445
    I'm thinking about you.     

596

       It's just amazing.       

597
00:24:16,515 --> 00:24:18,214
  He doesn't have to do that.   

598
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:20,150
      The Mike I know said      

599
00:24:20,185 --> 00:24:21,785
  he would never forget Tommy,

  'please God, I hope I don't

 And in walked Mayor Bloomberg. 

1030

 I'm Margaret Brick, and my son 

1033
00:45:28,007 --> 00:45:29,540
      Tommy Brick was the

00:45:29,575 --> 00:45:30,942
 first firefighter to be killed 

1035
00:45:30,977 --> 00:45:34,078

1036
00:45:34,113 --> 00:45:35,880
    I said what is going to     

1037

    happen to his children?     

1038
00:45:38,451 --> 00:45:39,750
 Without even skipping a beat,  

1039
00:45:39,786 --> 00:45:41,586
        Mike said to me,        

1040
00:45:41,621 --> 00:45:43,521
 'the fire department will take 

1041

1042
00:45:45,225 --> 00:45:46,391
       but if they don't,       

1043
00:45:46,426 --> 00:45:48,493
     I will do it myself.'      

1044
00:45:48,528 --> 00:45:50,094

  He doesn't have to do that.   

1051
00:45:59,706 --> 00:46:01,606
      The Mike I know said      

1052
00:46:01,641 --> 00:46:03,241
  he would never forget Tommy,

Don't use if you're             
allergic to Taltz.              

1248
00:54:12,273 --> 00:54:14,741
Before starting,                
get checked for

1251
00:54:18,547 --> 00:54:20,814
Tell your doctor about          
infections, symptoms,           

1252
00:54:20,882 --> 00:54:23,850
or if inflammatory bowel disease
symptoms develop, worsen        

1253
00:54:23,919 --> 00:54:26,086
      or if you've had a        
      vaccine or plan to.       

1254
00:54:26,154 --> 00:54:28,355
Serious allergic                
reactions can occur.            

1255
00:54:28,423 --> 00:54:29,923
     See the possibilities.     

1256
00:54:29,992 --> 00:54:31,958
  Ask your doctor about Taltz.
