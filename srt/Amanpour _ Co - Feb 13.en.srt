LAWLESS COMMUNITY WITH HIGH

00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:58,977
COMMENTS THAT WE WERE NOT A     
LAWLESS COMMUNITY WITH HIGH     
CRIME RATES BEFORE THE FENCE

PRESIDENCY IN 2008.             

197
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:07,085
WENT UP UNDER THE BUSH          
PRESIDENCY IN 2008.             
CERTAINLY IT IS A CONTRIBUTING  

198
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:08,887
PRESIDENCY IN 2008.             
CERTAINLY IT IS A CONTRIBUTING  
FACTOR TOWARDS, TO OUR SAFETY   

199
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:13,358
CERTAINLY IT IS A CONTRIBUTING  
FACTOR TOWARDS, TO OUR SAFETY   
HERE, BUT IT IS -- IT WAS NOT   

200
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,928
FACTOR TOWARDS, TO OUR SAFETY   
HERE, BUT IT IS -- IT WAS NOT   
THE SOLE PANACEA PRIOR TO,      

201
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,197
HERE, BUT IT IS -- IT WAS NOT   
THE SOLE PANACEA PRIOR TO,      
THAT'S ALL I'VE TRIED TO SAY.

00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,736
I'VE NOT SPOKEN AGAINST PHYSICAL
BARRIERS OF ANY TYPE.           
I THINK THAT'S A PART OF THAT   

205
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:25,803
BARRIERS OF ANY TYPE.           
I THINK THAT'S A PART OF THAT   
WHOLE PROCESS.                  

206
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:28,539
I THINK THAT'S A PART OF THAT   
WHOLE PROCESS.                  
YOU MENTIONED EARLIER THERE IS

YOU MENTIONED EARLIER THERE IS  
78 MILES OF FENCE IN THE EL PASO
SECTOR FOR THE BORDER CONTROL.  

209
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:34,812
78 MILES OF FENCE IN THE EL PASO
SECTOR FOR THE BORDER CONTROL.  
IT'S NOT CONTINUOUS.            

210
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:36,247
SECTOR FOR THE BORDER CONTROL.  
IT'S NOT CONTINUOUS.            
A GROUP OF THE FENCING THAT WENT

211
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:39,250
IT'S NOT CONTINUOUS.            
A GROUP OF THE FENCING THAT WENT
UP UNDER THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION

212
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:41,352
A GROUP OF THE FENCING THAT WENT
UP UNDER THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION
IN 2008 WAS PRIMARILY A         

213
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:45,023
UP UNDER THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION
IN 2008 WAS PRIMARILY A         
REPLACEMENT OF ABOUT TEN MILES  

214
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,659
IN 2008 WAS PRIMARILY A         
REPLACEMENT OF ABOUT TEN MILES  
OF CHAIN LINK THAT HAD HOLES IN 

215
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:48,726
REPLACEMENT OF ABOUT TEN MILES

216
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:50,995
OF CHAIN LINK THAT HAD HOLES IN 
IT AND WITH FORESTS.            
SO REALLY TO MY KNOWLEDGE, IT   

217
00:08:50,997 --> 00:09:03,441
IT AND WITH FORESTS.            
SO REALLY TO MY KNOWLEDGE, IT   
WASN'T EXPANDING THE FENCING.   

218
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:04,275
SO REALLY TO MY KNOWLEDGE, IT   
WASN'T EXPANDING THE FENCING.   
IT WAS MERELY IMPROVING IT.     

219
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:05,009
WASN'T EXPANDING THE FENCING.   
IT WAS MERELY IMPROVING IT.     
>> AND TO YOUR POINT, I DO WANT 

220
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:05,643
IT WAS MERELY IMPROVING IT.

TO DIG DOWN, IT IS WORTH        
CONSTANTLY PUTTING THE FACTS OUT

222
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,145
TO DIG DOWN, IT IS WORTH        
CONSTANTLY PUTTING THE FACTS OUT
THERE ON THE CRIME FIGURES ON   

223
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:07,879
CONSTANTLY PUTTING THE FACTS OUT

IT WAS INTERESTING, BETO

00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:17,755
THEM.                           
IT WAS INTERESTING, BETO        
O'ROURKE TALKS ABOUT IT BEING   

228
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,757
IT WAS INTERESTING, BETO        
O'ROURKE TALKS ABOUT IT BEING   
ONE OF THE SAFEST SECTORS.      

229
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,959
O'ROURKE TALKS ABOUT IT BEING   
ONE OF THE SAFEST SECTORS.      
IN CALIFORNIA, ALONG THE BORDER,

230
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:24,929
ONE OF THE SAFEST SECTORS.      
IN CALIFORNIA, ALONG THE BORDER,
SORT OF MAKING A POINT THAT     

231
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,197
IN CALIFORNIA, ALONG THE BORDER,
SORT OF MAKING A POINT THAT     
ACTUALLY MANY OF THE CITIES     

232
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:28,633
SORT OF MAKING A POINT THAT     
ACTUALLY MANY OF THE CITIES     
ALONG THE BORDER ARE SAFER THAN 

233
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:30,034
ACTUALLY MANY OF THE CITIES

THOSE FURTHER INLAND.           

234
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:33,071
ALONG THE BORDER ARE SAFER THAN 
THOSE FURTHER INLAND.           
WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THAT?      

235
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,940
THOSE FURTHER INLAND.           
WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THAT?      
>> WELL, FROM OUR STANDPOINT,   

236
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:39,110
WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THAT?      
>> WELL, FROM OUR STANDPOINT,   
YES, FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND,    

237
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:42,647
>> WELL, FROM OUR STANDPOINT,   
YES, FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND,    
EL PASO IS RANKED THE SAFEST    

238
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:43,281
YES, FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND,    
EL PASO IS RANKED THE SAFEST    
CITY.                           

239
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:44,048
EL PASO IS RANKED THE SAFEST    
CITY.                           
THAT'S ACCORDING TO UNIFORM     

240
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,450

ABLE TO INTERCEPT PEOPLE IF THEY

1229
00:40:30,961 --> 00:40:32,293
THE INTELLIGENT WAY TO SPEND THE

BARRIERS REALLY DISCOURAGE A    
CERTAIN KIND OF CASUAL CROSSER. 

1244
00:40:57,887 --> 00:40:59,520
BARRIERS REALLY DISCOURAGE A
