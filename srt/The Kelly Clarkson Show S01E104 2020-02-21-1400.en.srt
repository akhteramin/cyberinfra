COMING UP NEXT WE HAVE CHEF ROY

COMING UP NEXT WE HAVE CHEF ROY 
CHOI, Y'ALL!                    

827
00:31:36,724 --> 00:31:37,991
This is a story of the American 

828
00:31:38,026 --> 00:31:38,758
             Dream.             

829
00:31:38,794 --> 00:31:39,859
  It starts here, in a middle   

830
00:31:39,895 --> 00:31:41,261
class neighborhood with a middle

831
00:31:41,296 --> 00:31:43,029
     class kid named Mike.      

832
00:31:43,065 --> 00:31:44,431
When his father died, his mother

833
00:31:44,466 --> 00:31:45,732
  went to work and became the   

834
00:31:45,767 --> 00:31:46,466
          breadwinner.          

835
00:31:46,501 --> 00:31:47,534
     She instilled in Mike      

836
00:31:47,569 --> 00:31:49,135
  a belief in hard work and a   

837
00:31:49,171 --> 00:31:50,804
 drive to build a better life.  

838
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:52,072
  So he started a company from  

839
00:31:52,107 --> 00:31:53,974
scratch with an idea and endless

840
00:31:54,009 --> 00:31:56,109
hours- today, that makes him the

841
00:31:56,144 --> 00:31:57,677
   only democrat in the race    

842
00:31:57,713 --> 00:31:59,813
   who's created 20,000 jobs.   

843
00:31:59,848 --> 00:32:01,448
He's the only democrat who's run

844
00:32:01,483 --> 00:32:02,349
      the largest and most      

845
00:32:02,384 --> 00:32:03,750
    diverse city in America,    

846
00:32:03,785 --> 00:32:05,819
rebuilding after 9-11, creating 

847
00:32:05,854 --> 00:32:08,722
over 450,000 jobs and expanding 

848
00:32:08,757 --> 00:32:10,857
health care coverage to 700,000 

849
00:32:10,892 --> 00:32:11,558
            people.             

850
00:32:11,593 --> 00:32:12,859
The only democrat who's built a 

851
00:32:12,894 --> 00:32:14,461
 grassroots movement to combat  

852
00:32:14,496 --> 00:32:15,729
    gun violence and he's a     

853
00:32:15,764 --> 00:32:16,930
   leader combatting climate    

854
00:32:16,965 --> 00:32:17,630
            change.             

855
00:32:17,666 --> 00:32:19,399
 The only democrat who's never  

856
00:32:19,434 --> 00:32:20,834
   taken a penny from special   

857
00:32:20,869 --> 00:32:21,668
           interests.           

858
00:32:21,703 --> 00:32:23,036
 Now Mike is running to deliver 

859
00:32:23,071 --> 00:32:24,237
     on the American Dream      

860

863
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:29,976
 Because Mike Bloomberg is the  

864
00:32:30,011 --> 00:32:31,978
 only democrat who can take on  

865

00:53:38,410 --> 00:53:39,976
 Newspapers report Bloomberg is 

1351
00:53:40,011 --> 00:53:41,611
 the Democrat Trump fears most. 

1352
00:53:41,646 --> 00:53:42,912
    As president, universal

healthcare that lets people keep

their coverage if they like it. 

1355

   A record on job creation.

1358
00:53:49,421 --> 00:53:51,354
 I led a complex, diverse city

  and I approve this message.   

1365
00:54:00,966 --> 00:54:01,898
We don't need a ton of channels.

1366

 All we need is a fast internet 
 connection.

1368

Fast internet. All the channels.
