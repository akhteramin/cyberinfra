          cold turkey.          

704
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:12,569
  So CHANTIX can help you quit  
          slow turkey.          

705
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:16,239
  Along with support, CHANTIX   
  is proven to help you quit.   

706
00:21:16,274 --> 00:21:18,641
   With CHANTIX you can keep    
        smoking at first        

707
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:20,744

    with or without CHANTIX,    

711
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,490
     you may have nicotine      
     withdrawal symptoms.       

712
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:35,225
        Stop CHANTIX and        
      get help right away

      Robitussin. Because       
    it's never just a cough.

    I'm your Mother in Law.     

1463
00:54:27,028 --> 00:54:29,429
  And I like to question your   
          every move.           

1464
00:54:29,464 --> 00:54:30,430
      Like this left turn.      

1465

       It's the next one.       

1466
00:54:31,132 --> 00:54:31,798
  You always drive this slow?   

1467
00:54:31,833 --> 00:54:33,866
How did you make someone I love?

1468
00:54:33,902 --> 00:54:35,268
 That must be why you're always 
            so late.            

1469
00:54:35,303 --> 00:54:37,103
        I do not speed.         

1470
00:54:37,138 --> 00:54:39,172
 And that's saving me cash with 
           Drivewise.           

1471
00:54:39,207 --> 00:54:41,474
My son, he did say that you were
        the safe option.        

1472
00:54:41,509 --> 00:54:43,609
And that's the nicest thing you 
        ever said to me.        

1473
00:54:43,645 --> 00:54:44,710
        So get Allstate.        

1474
00:54:44,746 --> 00:54:45,912
         Stop bossing.          

1475
00:54:45,947 --> 00:54:49,482
Where good drivers save 40% for 
   avoiding mayhem, like me.    

1476
00:54:49,517 --> 00:54:52,385
This is my son's favorite color,
       you should try it.       

1477
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:54,187
 [Mayhem] You always drive like 
          an old lady?          

1478
00:54:54,222 --> 00:54:55,455
   [Tina] You're an old lady.

class kid who made good.        

1480
00:56:08,396 --> 00:56:11,864
 But Mike Bloomberg became the  
       guy who<i> did</i> good.        

1481
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:14,867
 After building a business that 
   created thousands of jobs    

1482
00:56:14,903 --> 00:56:17,870
 he took charge of a city still 
       reeling from 9/11        

1483
00:56:17,906 --> 00:56:21,374
 a three-term mayor who helped  
 bring it back from the ashes   

1484
00:56:21,409 --> 00:56:23,042
 bringing jobs and thousands of 

1485
00:56:23,077 --> 00:56:24,710
affordable housing              
units with it.                  

1486
00:56:24,746 --> 00:56:27,880
After witnessing the terrible   
toll of gun violence...         

1487
00:56:27,982 --> 00:56:29,415
he helped create a movement     
to protect                      

1488
00:56:29,450 --> 00:56:30,916
families across America.        

1489
00:56:30,952 --> 00:56:33,886
And stood up to the coal        
lobby and this administration   

1490
00:56:33,921 --> 00:56:36,222
 to protect this planet from    
 climate change.                

1491
00:56:36,257 --> 00:56:40,226
And now, he's taking on...
