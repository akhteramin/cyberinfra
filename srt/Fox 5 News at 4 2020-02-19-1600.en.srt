   Looking around here I see    

1062
00:42:38,926 --> 00:42:41,126
     tablets, laptops,          
     printers, smartphones.     

1063
00:42:41,195 --> 00:42:41,827
     They're all connected

     They're all connected.     

1066
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:45,230
    Can your network handle     
    all those devices?          

1067
00:42:45,299 --> 00:42:46,398

1070
00:42:49,469 --> 00:42:50,902
       So you can get the       
       bandwidth you need       

1071
00:42:50,971 --> 00:42:53,338
  to power all of your devices  
  at peak performance.          

1072
00:42:53,407 --> 00:42:56,074
   If all of my devices could   
   have that kind of speed,

1080
00:43:37,183 --> 00:43:38,483
For hundreds of years           

1081
00:43:38,485 --> 00:43:41,653
America systematically          
  stole Black lives,            

1082
00:43:41,655 --> 00:43:43,722
Black freedom and Black labor.  

1083
00:43:43,724 --> 00:43:46,792
And I know my story would've    
 turned out very differently    

1084
00:43:46,794 --> 00:43:48,226
if I had been Black.            

1085
00:43:48,228 --> 00:43:51,196
So today I'm proposing a        
   sweeping strategy            

1086
00:43:51,198 --> 00:43:54,065
to invest in Black              
 wealth creation.               

1087
00:43:54,067 --> 00:43:56,201
The wealth gap                  
is inextricably linked          

1088
00:43:56,203 --> 00:43:58,870
to the racial                   
inequalities of the past,       

1089
00:43:58,872 --> 00:44:01,573
and I'm determined to           
make breaking that link
