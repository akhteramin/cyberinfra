HOW THE MAKER OF THE POPULAR    
RING CAMERA IS TRYING TO H MISS.

1069
00:37:58,242 --> 00:38:00,843
   My body is truly powerful.   

1070
00:38:00,912 --> 00:38:02,177
I have the power to lower       

1071
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:04,546
my blood sugar and A1C.         

1072
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:05,447
      Because I can still       

1073
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:06,548
      make my own insulin.      

1074
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:07,917
    And Trulicity activates     

1075
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:08,817
     my body to release it      

1076
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:11,020
     like it's supposed to.     

1077
00:38:11,088 --> 00:38:13,555
    Trulicity is for people     
    with type 2 diabetes.       

1078
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:14,923
       It's not insulin.        

1079
00:38:14,992 --> 00:38:16,358
     I take it once a week.     

1080
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:18,460
   It starts acting in my       
   body from the first dose.    

1081
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:21,230
   Trulicity isn't for people   
   with type 1 diabetes         

1082
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,965
   or diabetic ketoacidosis.    

1083
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:25,334
   Don't take Trulicity         
   if you're allergic to it,    

1084
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:27,803
   you or your family have      
   medullary thyroid cancer,    

1085
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:30,773
   or have multiple endocrine   
   neoplasia syndrome type 2.   

1086
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:32,975
    Stop Trulicity and call     
    your doctor right away      

1087
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:34,476
       if you have an           
       allergic reaction,       

1088
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:35,844
a lump or swelling in your neck,

1089
00:38:35,913 --> 00:38:37,079
    or severe stomach pain.     

1090
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,682
   Serious side effects         
   may include pancreatitis.    

1091
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:42,584
    Taking Trulicity with a     
    sulfonylurea or insulin     

1092
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,253
increases low blood sugar risk. 

1093
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:47,489
Side effects include nausea,    
diarrhea, vomiting, belly pain, 

1094
00:38:47,558 --> 00:38:48,924
    and decreased appetite,     

1095
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:52,094
 which lead to dehydration and  
 may worsen kidney problems.    

1096
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,963
I have it within me             
to lower my A1C.                

1097
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:57,066
Ask your doctor about Trulicity.

     reported weight loss.      

1357
00:49:53,422 --> 00:49:54,888
