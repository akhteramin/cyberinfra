  Patients want something that  
     works faster for them.     

821
00:29:23,295 --> 00:29:24,862
   Why would somebody want to   
   suffer if there is options

00:29:24,897 --> 00:29:25,763
    that they don't need to.    

823
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:27,531
   I think dentists will want   
          to recommend          

824
00:29:27,566 --> 00:29:28,966
     Sensodyne Rapid Relief

       to work in 3 days.       

826
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:32,736
Which means for patients that   

827
00:29:32,772 --> 00:29:34,405
they get relief very fast.

WHO COULD SHARE THE STAGE WITH  

1055
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,308
WHO COULD SHARE THE STAGE WITH  
JENNIFER LOPEZ AND SHAKIRA?     

1056
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:53,376
JENNIFER LOPEZ AND SHAKIRA?     
COME ON BA                      

1057
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:55,512
 So I stopped in at Chick-fil-A 
 for lunch                      

1058
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,113
     and saw Officer Wilson     
     come in.                   

1059
00:36:57,149 --> 00:36:59,115
  I decided to place a dine in  
  mobile order                  

1060
00:36:59,151 --> 00:37:01,151
 and have a cookie delivered to 
 him                            

1061
00:37:01,186 --> 00:37:03,486
 just to show appreciation for  
 his service for our community. 

1062
00:37:03,522 --> 00:37:06,523
 A few minutes later I noticed  
 that Officer Wilson had gotten 
 up and left,                   

1063
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:08,024
and I knew he hadn't gotten his 
cookie yet.                     

1064
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,192
   And I'm headed to my car.    

1065
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:12,028
I turn around and see Allie and 
she's running after me.         

1066
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:14,197
Mr. Policer Officer! Mr. Policer
Officer!                        

1067
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,166
  Usually when someone yells,   
  "Officer, officer!"           

1068
00:37:16,201 --> 00:37:18,168
  they want to ask me about a   
  ticket they got.              

1069
00:37:18,203 --> 00:37:20,136
I absolutely wanted the cookie. 

1070
00:37:20,172 --> 00:37:22,172
   This cookie is delicious.    

1071
00:37:23,607 --> 00:37:24,708
      (MOM VO)                  
      We fit a lot of life      

1072
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:26,276
   into our Subaru Forester.

     It's good to be back.

00:37:27,946 --> 00:37:28,945
          (MOM)                 
          It sure is.

00:37:29,281 --> 00:37:31,448
   (MOM VO)                     
   Over the years, we trusted   
   it to carry and protect      

1076
00:37:31,483 --> 00:37:33,616
   the things that were most    
   important to us.             

1077
00:37:36,455 --> 00:37:38,354
 We always knew we had a lot of 
 life ahead of us.              

1078
00:37:39,124 --> 00:37:40,123

 That's why we chose a car that 
 we knew would be there for us

  Welcome to the all-new 2019   
  Subaru Forester.              

1082
00:37:48,467 --> 00:37:54,304

   trusted Forester ever.

      the lack of control       
      over my business          

1084
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:57,774
   made me a little intense.    

1085
00:37:57,809 --> 00:37:59,876
       But now QuickBooks       
       helps me get paid,       

1086
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:01,011
       manage cash flow,        

1087

        and run payroll.        

1088
00:38:02,114 --> 00:38:03,513
   And now I'm back on top...

1092

   than rheumatoid arthritis    
    or psoriatic arthritis.     

1093
00:38:13,892 --> 00:38:15,859
        When considering        
       another treatment,       

1094
00:38:15,861 --> 00:38:17,927
     ask about XELJANZ XR,      

1095
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:20,463
  a once-daily pill for adults  
         with moderate          

1096
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:24,601
 to severe rheumatoid arthritis 
 or active psoriatic arthritis  

1097
00:38:24,603 --> 00:38:27,003
     for whom methotrexate      
   did not work well enough.    

1098
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:28,938
 It can reduce pain, swelling,  

1099
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:32,108
   and significantly improve    
       physical function.       

1100
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:35,645
 XELJANZ can lower your ability 
  to fight infections like TB;  

1101
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:38,081
      don't start XELJANZ       
   if you have an infection.    

1102
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:39,716
        Taking a higher         
     than recommended dose      

1103
00:38:39,718 --> 00:38:42,318
       of XELJANZ for RA        
  can increase risk of death.   

1104
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,454
       Serious, sometimes       
       fatal infections,        

1105
00:38:44,456 --> 00:38:47,657
  cancers including lymphoma,   
 and blood clots have happened. 

1106
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:49,893
  As have tears in the stomach  
         or intestines,         

1107
00:38:49,895 --> 00:38:53,363
  serious allergic reactions,   
  and changes in lab results.   

1108
00:38:53,365 --> 00:38:54,898
      Tell your doctor if       
     you've been somewhere      

1109
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,566
       fungal infections        
          are common,           

1110
00:38:56,568 --> 00:38:58,935
      or if you've had TB,      
       hepatitis B or C,        

1111
00:38:58,937 --> 00:39:01,070
  or are prone to infections.   

1112
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:02,939
   Don't let another morning    
             go by              

1113
00:39:02,941 --> 00:39:04,674
   without asking your doctor   
             about              

1114
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:07,177
          XELJANZ XR.           

1115
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:09,379
     It's amazing what you      
          can uncover           

1116
00:39:09,414 --> 00:39:11,748
     with your DNA results      
        from Ancestry®.         

1117
00:39:11,783 --> 00:39:14,384
     I was able to discover     
          one cousin,           

1118
00:39:14,419 --> 00:39:16,085
      reached out to him,       

1119
00:39:16,121 --> 00:39:17,387
        visited Ireland,        

1120
00:39:17,422 --> 00:39:19,055
    met another 20 cousins.     

1121
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:21,257
        They took me to         
      the Cliffs of Moher,      

1122
00:39:21,293 --> 00:39:24,160
      the ancestral home,       
        the family bar.         

1123
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:27,197
  It really gives you a sense   
      of connection to...       

1124
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:29,666
        something that's        
     bigger than yourself.
