686
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,443
SHOWERS WILL HAVE PASSED.       
SO EVEN THEN IT WILL BE DRY.    

687
00:28:32,445 --> 00:28:33,077
SO EVEN THEN IT WILL BE DRY.    
>> SOUNDS GOOD.                 

688
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:49,326
>> SOUNDS GOOD.                 
THAT'S IT                       

689
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:50,260
         Stay safe man.         

690
00:28:50,296 --> 00:28:51,061
   See you when you get back.   

691
00:28:51,097 --> 00:28:51,695
          Count on it.          

692
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:03,240
 Hey babygirl, Daddy's gotta go 
           for a bit.           

693
00:29:03,275 --> 00:29:04,475
         I'll be back.          

694
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:14,818
           I promise.           

695
00:29:14,854 --> 00:29:17,554
           Come here.           

696
00:29:32,037 --> 00:29:33,270
       Goodnight sweetie.       

697
00:29:33,305 --> 00:29:37,407
        Goodnight mommy.        

698
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:40,577
  Can we try without the hat?   

699
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:45,249
