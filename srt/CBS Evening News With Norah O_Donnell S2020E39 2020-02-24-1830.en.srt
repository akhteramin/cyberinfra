           and become           
        harder to treat.        

655
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:47,090
 Your hepatitis B may get worse 
 or become life-threatening...  

656
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:49,793
   if you stop taking DOVATO.

664
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:05,742
   stop taking DOVATO and get   
    medical help right away.    

665
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:07,777
  Tell your doctor if you have  
  kidney or liver problems,...  

666
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:09,379
  including hepatitis B or C.   

667
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:11,581
One of the ingredients in DOVATO
        may harm your...        

668

669
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,284
   Your doctor may prescribe    
    a different medicine...     

670
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:16,386
than DOVATO. Your doctor should 
     do a pregnancy test...     

671
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:17,620
       before starting...       

672
00:19:17,622 --> 00:19:19,556
     DOVATO. Use effective      
        birth control...

      while taking DOVATO.      

674
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,727
  The most common side effects  
are headache, diarrhea, nausea, 

675
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:25,829
trouble sleeping, and tiredness.

676
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,764
 So much goes into who I am...  

677
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:29,132
        and hope to be.         

678
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:31,768
  Ask your doctor if starting   
   HIV treatment with DOVATO    

679
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:32,836
       is right for you.

     treatment that targets,    

931
00:29:18,989 --> 00:29:22,624
     freezes, and eliminates    
   treated fat cells for good.  

932
00:29:22,726 --> 00:29:24,459
      Discuss Coolsculpting     
        with your doctor.       

933
00:29:24,561 --> 00:29:26,895
    Some common side-effects    
   include temporary numbness,  

934
00:29:26,997 --> 00:29:28,463
    discomfort, and swelling.   

935
00:29:28,565 --> 00:29:30,632
     Don't imagine results,     
            see them.           

936
00:29:30,734 --> 00:29:33,902
         Coolsculpting,         
     take yourself further.     

937
00:29:34,337 --> 00:29:35,637
For hundreds of years           

938
00:29:35,639 --> 00:29:38,807
America systematically          
  stole Black lives,            

939
00:29:38,809 --> 00:29:40,876
Black freedom and Black labor.  

940
00:29:40,878 --> 00:29:43,945
And I know my story would've    
 turned out very differently    

941
00:29:43,947 --> 00:29:45,380
if I had been Black.            

942
00:29:45,382 --> 00:29:48,350
So today I'm proposing a        
   sweeping strategy            

943
00:29:48,352 --> 00:29:51,219
to invest in Black              
 wealth creation.               

944
00:29:51,221 --> 00:29:53,355
The wealth gap                  
is inextricably linked          

945
00:29:53,357 --> 00:29:56,024
to the racial                   
inequalities of the past,       

946
00:29:56,026 --> 00:29:58,727
and I'm determined to           
make breaking that link         

947
00:29:58,729 --> 00:30:00,428
a centerpiece of my             
presidency.
