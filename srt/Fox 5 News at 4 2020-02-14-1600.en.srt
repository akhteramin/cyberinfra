        OK, let me tell         

484
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:00,561
     you what the 'it' is.      

485
00:13:00,597 --> 00:13:01,329
           As Mayor,            

486
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:03,297
I expanded healthcare coverage. 

487
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:04,132
         As President,          

488
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:05,700
    I'll build on Obamacare     

489
00:13:05,735 --> 00:13:09,971
 because healthcare is a right. 

490
00:13:10,006 --> 00:13:10,905
        I created nearly        

491
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:14,008
 500,000 jobs in New York City. 

492
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:14,776
         As President,          

493
00:13:14,811 --> 00:13:16,144
     I'll build an economy      

494
00:13:16,179 --> 00:13:17,545
    that delivers good jobs     

495
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,747
       with higher wages.       

496
00:13:19,783 --> 00:13:21,215
   I'll take on the gun lobby   

497
00:13:21,251 --> 00:13:24,052
        and save lives.         

498
00:13:24,087 --> 00:13:26,254
And I will stop Trump's assault 

499
00:13:26,289 --> 00:13:29,424
on women's reproductive rights. 

500
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:30,058
       I've got a record        

501
00:13:30,093 --> 00:13:31,459
        of doing things.        

502
00:13:31,494 --> 00:13:32,527
     I've got the resources     

503
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:34,495
     to take on this fight.     

504
00:13:34,531 --> 00:13:35,396
           As mayor,            

505
00:13:35,432 --> 00:13:36,230
         I held myself          

506
00:13:36,266 --> 00:13:38,266
    accountable for results.    

507
00:13:38,301 --> 00:13:39,067
         As President,          

508
00:13:39,102 --> 00:13:41,703
 I'll offer common sense plans  

509
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:44,238
    and I will get it done.     

510
00:13:44,274 --> 00:13:46,140
So let's stay on the offensive, 

511
00:13:46,176 --> 00:13:48,309
         and let's win.         

512
00:13:48,344 --> 00:13:49,210
       I'm Mike Bloomberg
