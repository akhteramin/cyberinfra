    you're doing what's right,  

1138
00:46:52,264 --> 00:46:53,230
       to protect your dog

00:46:53,265 --> 00:46:54,298
          from fleas and ticks  

1140
00:46:54,333 --> 00:46:55,232
          for a full month.     

1141
00:46:55,267 --> 00:46:57,534
  It's the #1 Vet recommended   
          protection.           

1142

  What one little chew can do.  

1144
00:47:17,989 --> 00:47:19,656
      Working with Mike         
      Bloomberg was one of      

1145
00:47:19,658 --> 00:47:22,292
   the most empowering          
   experiences that I've had.   

1146
00:47:22,294 --> 00:47:25,562
It's important to talk to the   
people who know him personally. 

1147
00:47:25,564 --> 00:47:27,530
I worked for him for            
8 years in City Hall.           

1148
00:47:27,532 --> 00:47:30,333
I've been working for           
Bloomberg for 27 years.         

1149
00:47:30,335 --> 00:47:31,501
           25 years.            

1150
00:47:31,503 --> 00:47:33,203
                Almost 30 years.

1151
00:47:33,205 --> 00:47:35,004
There's nobody that             
I respect more,                 

1152
00:47:35,006 --> 00:47:36,940
and felt more                   
respected by.                   

1153
00:47:36,942 --> 00:47:38,942
Mike believes                   
excellence                      

1154
00:47:38,944 --> 00:47:40,209
is not defined by gender.       

1155
00:47:40,211 --> 00:47:43,179
Mike builds a culture           
that advances women.            

1156
00:47:43,181 --> 00:47:44,947
I was the first woman           
ever appointed                  

1157
00:47:44,949 --> 00:47:46,115
to be council                   
to the Mayor.                   

1158
00:47:46,117 --> 00:47:48,518
He expects excellence           
out of everyone,                

1159
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,253
but he also provides            
the kind of support             

1160
00:47:50,255 --> 00:47:52,688
that allows you to              
be that person.                 

1161
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:54,090
    Mike called to tell me,     

1162
00:47:54,092 --> 00:47:55,758
     you should be proud of     
     what you've done           

1163
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,827
    and your name should be     
        on that project.        

1164
00:47:57,829 --> 00:47:59,929
      He has faith in you,      
      he believes in you.       

1165
00:47:59,931 --> 00:48:02,298
     It was about always showing
         up and doing your best.

1166
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:04,266
              I always knew that
                 he had my back.

1167
00:48:04,268 --> 00:48:06,068
      He was raised by an       
      extraordinary woman,      

1168
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:07,870
       she supported him        
       all along the way        

1169
00:48:07,872 --> 00:48:10,673
      and that's very much      
      a part of who he is.      

1170
00:48:10,675 --> 00:48:12,007
     Mike supports women,       

1171
00:48:12,009 --> 00:48:14,143
     he promotes women, and     
     he respects women.

      Working with Mike         
      Bloomberg was one of      

1383
00:58:09,497 --> 00:58:12,131
   the most empowering          
   experiences that I've had.   

1384
00:58:12,133 --> 00:58:15,401
It's important to talk to the   
people who know him personally. 

1385
00:58:15,403 --> 00:58:17,369
I worked for him for            
8 years in City Hall.           

1386
00:58:17,371 --> 00:58:20,172
I've been working for           
Bloomberg for 27 years.         

1387
00:58:20,174 --> 00:58:21,340
           25 years.            

1388
00:58:21,342 --> 00:58:23,041
                Almost 30 years.

1389
00:58:23,043 --> 00:58:24,843
There's nobody that             
I respect more,                 

1390
00:58:24,845 --> 00:58:26,778
and felt more                   
respected by.                   

1391
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:28,780
Mike believes                   
excellence                      

1392
00:58:28,782 --> 00:58:30,048
is not defined by gender.       

1393
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:33,018
Mike builds a culture           
that advances women.            

1394
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:34,786
I was the first woman           
ever appointed                  

1395
00:58:34,788 --> 00:58:35,954
to be council                   
to the Mayor.                   

1396
00:58:35,956 --> 00:58:38,356
He expects excellence           
out of everyone,                

1397
00:58:38,358 --> 00:58:40,092
but he also provides            
the kind of support             

1398
00:58:40,094 --> 00:58:42,527
that allows you to              
be that person.                 

1399
00:58:42,529 --> 00:58:43,929
    Mike called to tell me,     

1400
00:58:43,931 --> 00:58:45,597
     you should be proud of     
     what you've done           

1401
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:47,666
    and your name should be     
        on that project.        

1402
00:58:47,668 --> 00:58:49,768
      He has faith in you,      
      he believes in you.       

1403
00:58:49,770 --> 00:58:52,137
     It was about always showing
         up and doing your best.

1404
00:58:52,139 --> 00:58:54,105
              I always knew that
                 he had my back.

1405
00:58:54,107 --> 00:58:55,907
      He was raised by an       
      extraordinary woman,      

1406
00:58:55,909 --> 00:58:57,709
       she supported him        
       all along the way        

1407
00:58:57,711 --> 00:59:00,512
      and that's very much      
      a part of who he is.      

1408
00:59:00,514 --> 00:59:01,846
     Mike supports women,       

1409
00:59:01,848 --> 00:59:03,982
     he promotes women, and     
     he respects women.
