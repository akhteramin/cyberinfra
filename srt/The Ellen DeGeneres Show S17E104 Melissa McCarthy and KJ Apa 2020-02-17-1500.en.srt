 we'll do the shopping for you  

913
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:30,417
       so you can do more       
       of what you love.        

914
00:45:32,655 --> 00:45:33,787
  When your psoriasis is bad,   

915
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:35,856
      it can be hard to         
      see what's possible.      

916
00:45:35,925 --> 00:45:40,594
    But the possibilities       
    become clear with Taltz     

917
00:45:40,663 --> 00:45:42,296
     the first and only         
     treatment of its kind

       offering a chance        

919
00:45:43,132 --> 00:45:45,332
      at 100% clear skin.       

920
00:45:45,401 --> 00:45:46,934
With Taltz,                     
up to 90%                       

921
00:45:47,003 --> 00:45:49,003
of those with                   
moderate to                     
severe psoriasis                

922
00:45:49,072 --> 00:45:50,338
saw a significant               
improvement                     

923
00:45:50,406 --> 00:45:51,939
of their                        
psoriasis                       
plaques.                        

924
00:45:52,008 --> 00:45:54,242
Some even saw                   
100% clear skin.                

925
00:45:54,310 --> 00:45:56,711
Don't use if you're             
allergic to Taltz.              

926
00:45:56,779 --> 00:45:59,247
Before starting,                
get checked for                 
tuberculosis.                   

927
00:45:59,315 --> 00:46:00,681
Increased risk                  
of infections                   

928
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:02,984
           and lower ability to 
           fight them may occur.

929
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:05,319
Tell your doctor about          
infections, symptoms,           

930
00:46:05,388 --> 00:46:08,356
or if inflammatory bowel disease
symptoms develop, worsen        

931
00:46:08,425 --> 00:46:10,591
      or if you've had a        
      vaccine or plan to.       

932
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:12,860
Serious allergic                
reactions can occur.            

933
00:46:12,929 --> 00:46:14,429
     See the possibilities.     

934
00:46:14,497 --> 00:46:16,464
  Ask your doctor about Taltz.
