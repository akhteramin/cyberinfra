TRAFFIC AROUND THE DMV AS RUSH  
HOUR RAMPS UP.                  
WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.          

499
00:13:00,044 --> 00:13:00,176
                       BACK.    

500
00:13:56,033 --> 00:13:57,333
For hundreds of years           

501
00:13:57,335 --> 00:14:00,503
America systematically          
  stole Black lives,            

502
00:14:00,505 --> 00:14:02,572
Black freedom and Black labor.  

503
00:14:02,574 --> 00:14:05,641
And I know my story would've    
 turned out very differently    

504
00:14:05,643 --> 00:14:07,076
if I had been Black.            

505
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:10,046
So today I'm proposing a        
   sweeping strategy            

506
00:14:10,048 --> 00:14:12,915
to invest in Black              
 wealth creation.               

507
00:14:12,917 --> 00:14:15,051
The wealth gap                  
is inextricably linked          

508
00:14:15,053 --> 00:14:17,720
to the racial                   
inequalities of the past,       

509
00:14:17,722 --> 00:14:20,423
and I'm determined to           
make breaking that link         

510
00:14:20,425 --> 00:14:22,425
a centerpiece of my             
presidency.                     

511
00:14:56,894 --> 00:14:58,027
             Ready.             

512
00:15:00,231 --> 00:15:01,864
       When you sell with       
        a Redfin Agent,         

513
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,734
   more people see your home.   

514
00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:06,969
That's because more people visit
           Redfin.com           

515
00:15:07,005 --> 00:15:09,272
 than any other brokerage site. 

516
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:13,409
      So, the right buyers      
          come to you.          

517
00:15:19,817 --> 00:15:22,985
 And you sell for more than the 
       home next door...        

518
00:15:23,021 --> 00:15:25,721
 all for a 1% listing fee when  
       you buy and sell.

  tackle four things at once.   

1681
00:56:05,389 --> 00:56:07,522
  So when her car got hit, she  
         didn't worry.          

1682
00:56:07,558 --> 00:56:10,559
She simply filed a claim on her 
      USAA app and said...

00:56:10,594 --> 00:56:11,693

1684
00:56:11,728 --> 00:56:15,130
 USAA insurance is made the way 
     Kate needs it - easy.      

1685
00:56:15,165 --> 00:56:16,531
 She can even pick her payment
