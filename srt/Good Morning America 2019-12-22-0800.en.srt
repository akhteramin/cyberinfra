XELJANZ XR, a once-daily pill   
for adults with moderate        

1325
00:43:13,241 --> 00:43:15,207
to severe RA for whom           
methotrexate

did not work well enough.       

1327
00:43:16,411 --> 00:43:18,878
XELJANZ XR can reduce           
pain, swelling                  

1328
00:43:18,913 --> 00:43:21,881
and further joint damage,       
even without methotrexate.      

1329
00:43:21,916 --> 00:43:25,718
XELJANZ can lower your ability  
to fight infections like TB;    

1330
00:43:25,753 --> 00:43:28,220
don't start XELJANZ if          
you have an infection.          

1331
00:43:28,256 --> 00:43:31,057
Taking a higher than recommended
dose of XELJANZ for RA          

1332
00:43:31,092 --> 00:43:32,391
can increase risk of death.     

1333
00:43:32,427 --> 00:43:34,560
Serious, sometimes              
fatal infections,               

1334
00:43:34,595 --> 00:43:37,730
cancers including lymphoma, and 
blood clots have happened.      

1335
00:43:37,765 --> 00:43:40,066
As have tears in the stomach    
or intestines,                  

1336
00:43:40,101 --> 00:43:43,069
serious allergic reactions,     
and changes in lab results.     

1337
00:43:43,104 --> 00:43:44,737
Tell your doctor if you've      
been somewhere                  

1338
00:43:44,772 --> 00:43:46,238
fungal infections are common,   

1339
00:43:46,274 --> 00:43:48,574
or if you've had TB,            
hepatitis B or C,               

1340
00:43:48,609 --> 00:43:52,244
or are prone to infections.     

1341
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,246
Needles. Fine for some.         

1342
00:43:54,282 --> 00:43:55,848
But for you, one pill a day     

1343
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,350
may provide symptom relief.     

1344
00:43:57,385 --> 00:43:59,852
Ask your doctor about           
XELJANZ XR.

1470
00:48:53,747 --> 00:48:55,180
       if you have an

1476
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:08,193
Side effects include nausea,    
diarrhea, vomiting, belly pain, 

1477
00:49:08,262 --> 00:49:09,628
    and decreased appetite,
