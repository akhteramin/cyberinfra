114
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:44,489
                   GOT IT.      

115
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:45,791
           I WANT A GREAT WHITE.

116
00:03:48,429 --> 00:03:49,328
     GREAT WHITE                
WOULD NOT GO IN THERE.          

117
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,762
        NOT GONNA HAPPEN.       

118
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:53,065
 THEY CAN'T KEEP GREAT WHITES IN
 CAPTIVITY IN A PUBLIC AQUARIUM,

119
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:55,033
            LET ALONE           
       IN A HOME AQUARIUM.      

120
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:57,135
      -SO, NO GREAT WHITES?     
  -YOU WANT A FISH TANK, RIGHT? 

121
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:59,004
               YEAH, LET'S GO.  
      LET'S CHECK THE HOUSE OUT.

122
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:00,806
       BUT THEY "TANKED."       

123
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:02,107
           Brett: WOW!          

124
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:04,076
       I THINK I KNOW WHY       
   YOU BOUGHT THIS HOUSE, MAN,  

125
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:05,244
  'CAUSE THIS IS THE FRONT DOOR 

126
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:06,945
     THAT YOU CAN WALK INTO     
        WITHOUT DUCKING.        

127
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:08,947
             LET'S GO UPSTAIRS. 

128
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:11,283
  WHAT DO WE GOT HERE, FELLAS?  
       WHAT ROOM IS THIS?       

129
00:04:11,285 --> 00:04:12,351
            -BEDROOM.           
        -MASTER BEDROOM.        

130
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:14,086
   ALL RIGHT, SO,               
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?         

131
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:15,587
            I WANT TO PUT A TANK
                 OVER HERE.     

132
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,090
               MAYBE OVER HERE  
                OR OVER HERE.   

133
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:20,892
    WHERE'S THE TV GONNA GO,    
  AND WHERE'S THE BED GONNA GO? 

134
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:22,494
           I'M GONNA JUST CHOOSE
                THE OPPOSITE.   

135
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:24,763
  GOTCHA. SO, I WOULD RECOMMEND 
   MORE THE BED ON THIS SIDE,   

136
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,665
 BECAUSE IF THE SHOWER'S RUNNING
      AND YOU'RE SLEEPING,      

137
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:28,200
     YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR     
       THE WATER RUNNING.       

138
00:04:28,202 --> 00:04:30,636
  HE WAS NOT ASKING YOUR OPINION
           WHERE TO PUT HIS BED.

139
00:04:30,638 --> 00:04:31,703
I WAS JUST OFFERING.            

140
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:33,472
                LISTEN TO ME.   
   WE CAME HERE TO BUILD A TANK.

141
00:04:33,474 --> 00:04:34,473
                   FOCUS.       

142
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:35,741
      YOU WANT                  
SOMETHING SMALL, BIG?           

143
00:04:35,743 --> 00:04:37,109
       I MEAN,                  
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?       

144
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:38,610
              -BIG.             
-I KNEW YOU WERE GONNA SAY THAT.

145
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,612
-I KNEW YOU WERE GONNA SAY THAT.
              -BIG.             

146
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,147
   I HAD A FEELING              
  "BIG" WAS COMING.             

147
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:43,248
IF YOU WANT SOMETHING BIG,      

148
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,284
I WOULD SAY THE BEDROOM'S       
PROBABLY NOT THE SPOT           

149
00:04:45,286 --> 00:04:47,019
 BECAUSE NUMBER ONE,            
WE'RE ON THE SECOND FLOOR,      

150
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:48,553
OKAY, AND IT'S GONNA BE         
  A LOT OF WEIGHT.              

151
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:49,955
   SO IF YOU HAVE               
  A LOT OF WEIGHT,              

152
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:51,857
POTENTIALLY, YOU'D HAVE TO      
SHORE UP THE FLOORS.            

153
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:53,992
IT'D PROBABLY BE A NIGHTMARE,   
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?           

154
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:55,193
AND TO GET IT UP HERE           

155
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:57,095
WOULD JUST PROBABLY BE A PROBLEM
CONSIDERING THE STEPS.          

156
00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:58,430
                 THAT'S WHAT    
                I'M HERE FOR.   

157
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:00,065
          [ LAUGHTER ]          

158
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:01,600
     I GOT A SPOT FOR THIS.     
           I GOT SPOT.          

159
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:02,534
        -YOU GOT A SPOT?        
         -I GOT A SPOT.         

160
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:03,869
     ALL RIGHT,                 
LET'S GO CHECK IT OUT.          

161
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,404
        ALL RIGHT, GUYS,        
 WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THE VIEW? 

162
00:05:05,406 --> 00:05:07,239
  COOL, I LIKE IT.              
     WOW, NICE.                 

163
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:09,975
           I SEEN A DOLPHIN FLIP
        OUT THERE THE OTHER DAY.

164
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:16,381
I WAS THINKING ABOUT            
PUTTING A FISH TANK RIGHT HERE. 

165
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:19,685
NEXT TO THE HOT TUB.            
  IT GOT SPEAKERS.              

166
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:22,220
BRETT, YOU COULD SHOW ME        
YOUR FAVORITE DANCE MOVES.      

167
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:24,423
            -OH, MAN.           
              -HEY.             

168
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:25,891
            SO YOU WANT TO CHILL
               IN THE HOT TUB,  

169
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:28,226
     HAVE A NICE TANK OUT THERE,
                 AND ENJOY.     

170
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:30,762
 THINK OF SOMETHING             
   THAT'S AWESOME,              

171
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:32,798
 AND THEN TIMES THAT            
        BY 5.                   

172
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,899
AND THAT'S THE IDEA.            

173
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:35,400
    Both: SOMETHING AWESOME.    

174
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:37,369
                    HMM.        

175
00:05:37,371 --> 00:05:39,404
      MY ONLY CONCERN UP HERE --
             ONE, IT'S OUTSIDE. 

176
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:42,107
  YOU GOT TO TEMPERATURE CONTROL
  DURING THE WINTER AND SUMMERS.

177
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:44,609
        AND I DON'T KNOW        
   IF ANY MORE WEIGHT UP HERE   

178
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:45,610
        IS GONNA BE GOOD.       

179
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:47,079
         WE COULD THROW YOU OFF.

180
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:49,915
  I'M JUST SAYING THERE'S A LOT 
  OF WEIGHT UP HERE IN GENERAL. 

181
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:51,817
      SO, LET ME ASK A QUESTION.
    WHY DO YOU WANT A FISH TANK?

182
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:54,686
I LOVE FISH TANKS, YOU KNOW.    
I FEEL LIKE IT'S ART.           

183
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,688
    AND I HAD ONE               
 WHEN I WAS YOUNGER.            

184
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,724
      YOU KNOW,                 
I HAD A SALTWATER TANK.         

185
00:05:58,726 --> 00:06:01,927
IT WAS LIKE 100 GALLONS.        
SO I REALLY JUST -- I MISS IT.  

186
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:03,161
        YOU LIKE SALTWATER FISH.

187
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:04,329
      I LOVE --                 
I LOVE SALTWATER FISH.          

188
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:06,031
           ALL RIGHT,           
     YOU KNOW WHAT, FELLAS?     

189
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:08,667
  I LOVE YOUR IDEAS, BUT LET'S  
  GO CHECK OUT THE OTHER SPOT.  

190
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:10,068
       I THINK IT'S GONNA       
         WORK OUT BEST.         

191
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,037
YOU GOT TO GET ME SOMETHING.    
THEY DON'T LISTEN TO US.        

192
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:13,739
  YOU GOT TO GET US             
SOME SHARKS IN HERE.            

193
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:15,207
          -I'M TRYING.          
       -I NEED THE SHARK.       

194
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:17,976
                     ♪          

195
00:06:20,314 --> 00:06:23,482
    -WE GOT A SPOT OVER HERE.   
 -ALL RIGHT, LET'S CHECK IT OUT.

196
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:25,517
        ALL RIGHT, GUYS.        

197
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,253
 I GOT A CHEF OVER HERE COOKING 
        IT UP RIGHT NOW.        

198
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:29,921
           -CHEF RUDY.          
        -WHAT'S UP, CHEF?       

199
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:32,924
              SO I WAS THINKING 
                OF THIS SPOT.   

200
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:35,193
 THAT'S NOT A SPOT.             
   THIS IS A WALL.              

201
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:36,161
        IT'S A GOOD SPOT.       
           I LIKE IT.           

202
00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:37,562
            IT'S BIG.           

203
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:40,499
IT'S OPEN, AND YOU CAN          
SEE IT FROM ANY PLACE           
 IN THE HOUSE HERE.             

204
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:42,401
     MOST PEOPLE SPEND MOST     
  OF THEIR TIME IN THE KITCHEN. 

205
00:06:42,403 --> 00:06:44,569
         -THAT'S RIGHT.         
             -TRUE.             

206
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,304
SO YOU'RE THINKING BIG.         

207
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:50,509
           NO, I'M THINKING<i> BIG.</i>

208
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:51,843
        I CAN'T DO THAT.        

209
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:54,479
       THIS IS                  
A REALLY BIG CORNER.            

210
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:56,114
 YOU GOT TWO WALLS,             
      ACTUALLY.                 

211
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:57,182
YOU'RE ON FIRE TODAY.           

212
00:06:57,184 --> 00:06:59,184
  SHARKS DON'T LIKE             
  TO LIVE OUTDOORS.             

213
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:01,386
THE SPECIAL CORNER'S            
MADE UP OF TWO WALLS.           

214
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:03,855
 I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE            
WHAT YOU COME UP WITH NEXT.     

215
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:06,124
     MAYBE WE DO                
WHERE IT COMES FROM HERE,       

216
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:08,093
     COMES OUT,                 
  AND THEN IT BOWS.             

217
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:09,261
IT'S A BIG BOW FRONT.           

218
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:11,963
      -SO THE WHOLE CORNER?     
       -THE WHOLE CORNER.       

219
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:13,031
            HOLD ON.            

220
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:15,467
 YOU'RE THINKING OF BACK PANEL, 
           BACK PANEL,          

221
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:17,068
       AND THEN SOME SORT       
       OF A RADIUS FRONT.       

222
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:20,071
BIG, HUGE, RADIUS FRONT.

00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:06,177
THOSE LITTLE TENTACLES          
     ARE FILLED                 

450
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:09,013
    WITH MILLIONS               
OF WHAT ARE CALLED NEMATOCYSTS. 

451
00:24:09,015 --> 00:24:11,816
NEMATOCYSTS ARE LIKE            
A LITTLE, TINY HARPOON          

452
00:24:11,818 --> 00:24:13,284
WITH A TETHER ON IT.            

453
00:24:13,286 --> 00:24:16,987
AND SO, WHEN A FISH COMES OVER  
AND TOUCHES THE ANEMONE,        

454
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:19,290
      MILLIONS                  
OF THESE LITTLE HARPOONS        

455
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:21,258
    ARE INJECTED                
   INTO THE FISH.               

456
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:24,628
AND THEY'RE NOW STUCK           
 ON TO THE ANEMONE.             

457
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:28,699
AND THE FISH THEN IS PUSHED     
INTO THE CENTER OF THE MOUTH,   

458
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:30,868
    WHICH IS ALSO               
    THE STOMACH.                

459
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,870
        I KNOW THAT CLOWNFISH...

460
00:24:32,872 --> 00:24:34,038
       MM-HMM.                  

461
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,172
            ...LIVE IN ANEMONES.

462
00:24:35,174 --> 00:24:37,074
    YES, THEY DO.               
   THEY LOVE THEM.              

463
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:38,542
       HOW DO THEY NOT GET HURT?

464
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:41,912
MANY OF THEM USED CORALS        
     OR ANEMONES                

465
00:24:41,914 --> 00:24:44,582
AS THEIR SYMBIOTIC HOST.        

466
00:24:44,584 --> 00:24:47,885
THEY HIDE IN THEM FOR PROTECTION
AND AT THE SAME TIME,           

467
00:24:47,887 --> 00:24:51,755
BRING FOOD FOR THEIR ANEMONE    
   OR CORAL HOST.               

468
00:24:51,757 --> 00:24:53,657
   SO THEY'RE PAYING THEIR DUES.
       THEY'RE PAYING THEIR WAY.

469
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:56,293
      Agnes: WE CAN'T HAVE      
  A LIVING ANEMONE IN OUR TANK  

470
00:24:56,295 --> 00:24:57,862
     WITH ARTIFICIAL CORAL,     

471
00:24:57,864 --> 00:24:59,029
       BUT WE'LL MAKE SURE      

472
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:01,565
    THE CLOWNFISH HAVE PLACES   
     TO HIDE AND FEEL SAFE.     

473
00:25:01,567 --> 00:25:03,167
      LET'S GO.                 

474
00:25:06,439 --> 00:25:09,707
     A LIGHTNING                
  MAROON CLOWNFISH.             

475
00:25:09,709 --> 00:25:10,941
          THAT'S A MAROON CLOWN?

476
00:25:10,943 --> 00:25:11,976
 WHEN THEY'RE YOUNG,            

477
00:25:11,978 --> 00:25:13,944
   THEY TEND TO BE              
  KIND OF ORANGE-Y.             

478
00:25:13,946 --> 00:25:17,681
 AND AS THEY MATURE,            
THEY BECOME A DEEP MAROON RED.  

479
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:21,719
            I LIKE THE FACT THAT
 IT KIND OF HAS THE HEAT COLORS.

480
00:25:21,721 --> 00:25:23,220
      AND IT LOOKS LIKE A FLAME.

481
00:25:23,222 --> 00:25:25,222
            PERFECT.            
  HOW BIG WILL THESE GUYS GET?  

482
00:25:25,224 --> 00:25:28,893
    6 TO 7 INCHES               
ON A REALLY BIG ADULT FEMALE.   

483
00:25:28,895 --> 00:25:30,361
        THIS IS PERFECT.        

484

485
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:39,470
  WHOA! I'VE NEVER SEEN A FISH  
           LIKE THAT.           

486

                NO, IT'S ONE    
            OF THE DWARF ANGELS,

490
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,948
