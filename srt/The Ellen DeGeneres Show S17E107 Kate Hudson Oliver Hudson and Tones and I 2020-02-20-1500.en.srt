00:23:12,918 --> 00:23:14,918
of those with                   
moderate to                     
severe psoriasis                

600
00:23:14,987 --> 00:23:16,253
saw a significant               
improvement                     

601
00:23:16,322 --> 00:23:17,855
of their                        
psoriasis                       
plaques.                        

602
00:23:17,923 --> 00:23:20,157
Some even saw                   
100% clear skin.                

603
00:23:20,226 --> 00:23:22,626
Don't use if you're             
allergic to Taltz.              

604
00:23:22,695 --> 00:23:25,162
Before starting,                
get checked for                 
tuberculosis.                   

605
00:23:25,231 --> 00:23:26,597
Increased risk                  
of infections                   

606
00:23:26,665 --> 00:23:28,899
           and lower ability to 
           fight them may occur.

607
00:23:28,968 --> 00:23:31,235
Tell your doctor about          
infections, symptoms,           

608
00:23:31,303 --> 00:23:34,271
or if inflammatory bowel disease
symptoms develop, worsen        

609
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,507
      or if you've had a        
      vaccine or plan to.       

610
00:23:36,575 --> 00:23:38,775
Serious allergic                
reactions can occur.            

611
00:23:38,844 --> 00:23:40,344
     See the possibilities.     

612
00:23:40,412 --> 00:23:42,379
  Ask your doctor about Taltz.  

613
00:24:00,298 --> 00:24:01,231
      I remember thinking,      

614
00:24:01,267 --> 00:24:02,466
  'please God, I hope I don't   

615
00:24:02,501 --> 00:24:05,168
     meet the Mayor today.'     

616
00:24:05,204 --> 00:24:07,237
 And in walked Mayor Bloomberg. 

617
00:24:07,273 --> 00:24:09,773
       Soon as I saw him,       

618
00:24:09,808 --> 00:24:12,943
    I knew what that meant.     

619
00:24:12,978 --> 00:24:14,878
 I'm Margaret Brick, and my son 

620
00:24:14,913 --> 00:24:16,446
      Tommy Brick was the       

621
00:24:16,482 --> 00:24:17,848
 first firefighter to be killed 

622
00:24:17,883 --> 00:24:20,984
     in a fire after 9/11.      

623
00:24:21,019 --> 00:24:22,786
    I said what is going to     

624
00:24:22,821 --> 00:24:25,322
    happen to his children?     

625
00:24:25,357 --> 00:24:26,656
 Without even skipping a beat,  

626
00:24:26,692 --> 00:24:28,492
        Mike said to me,        

627
00:24:28,527 --> 00:24:30,427
 'the fire department will take 

628
00:24:30,462 --> 00:24:32,095
    good care of those kids,    

629
00:24:32,131 --> 00:24:33,296
       but if they don't,       

630
00:24:33,332 --> 00:24:35,398
     I will do it myself.'      

631
00:24:35,434 --> 00:24:37,000
     Every year around the      

632
00:24:37,035 --> 00:24:40,003
  anniversary, Mike calls me.   

633
00:24:40,038 --> 00:24:41,571
   It's sixteen years later,    

634
00:24:41,607 --> 00:24:42,739
 to just say I want you to know 

635
00:24:42,774 --> 00:24:43,807
    I'm thinking about you.     

636
00:24:43,842 --> 00:24:44,841
       It's just amazing.       

637
00:24:44,877 --> 00:24:46,576
  He doesn't have to do that.   

638
00:24:46,612 --> 00:24:48,511
      The Mike I know said      

639
00:24:48,547 --> 00:24:50,146
  he would never forget Tommy,  

640
00:24:50,182 --> 00:24:51,982
        and he has not.         

641
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:55,619
       I'm Mike Bloomberg       

642
00:24:55,654 --> 00:24:57,220
  and I approve this message.

1068
00:46:17,428 --> 00:46:19,395
 you can book a tour on demand. 

1069
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:21,664
  So you can see homes first.   

1070
00:46:21,699 --> 00:46:24,166
And with your local Redfin Agent
          guiding you,

1072

00:46:47,558 --> 00:46:48,758
  'please God, I hope I don't

 And in walked Mayor Bloomberg. 

1076
00:46:53,564 --> 00:46:56,065
       Soon as I saw him,       

1077
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:59,235
    I knew what that meant.     

1078
00:46:59,270 --> 00:47:01,170
 I'm Margaret Brick, and my son 

1079
00:47:01,205 --> 00:47:02,738
      Tommy Brick was the       

1080
00:47:02,774 --> 00:47:04,140
 first firefighter to be killed 

1081
00:47:04,175 --> 00:47:07,276
     in a fire after 9/11.      

1082
00:47:07,311 --> 00:47:09,078
    I said what is going to     

1083
00:47:09,113 --> 00:47:11,614
    happen to his children?     

1084
00:47:11,649 --> 00:47:12,948
 Without even skipping a beat,  

1085
00:47:12,984 --> 00:47:14,784
        Mike said to me,        

1086
00:47:14,819 --> 00:47:16,719
 'the fire department will take 

1087
00:47:16,754 --> 00:47:18,387
    good care of those kids,    

1088
00:47:18,422 --> 00:47:19,588
       but if they don't,       

1089
00:47:19,624 --> 00:47:21,690
     I will do it myself.'      

1090
00:47:21,726 --> 00:47:23,292
     Every year around the

  anniversary, Mike calls me.   

1092
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:27,863
   It's sixteen years later,    

1093
00:47:27,899 --> 00:47:29,031
 to just say I want you to know 

1094
00:47:29,066 --> 00:47:30,099
    I'm thinking about you.     

1095
00:47:30,134 --> 00:47:31,133
       It's just amazing.       

1096
00:47:31,168 --> 00:47:32,868
  He doesn't have to do that.   

1097
00:47:32,903 --> 00:47:34,803
      The Mike I know said      

1098
00:47:34,839 --> 00:47:36,438
  he would never forget Tommy,  

1099
