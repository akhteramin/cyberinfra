1033

100% clear skin.                

1034

Don't use if you're             
allergic to Taltz.              

1035
00:46:18,138 --> 00:46:20,605
Before starting,                
get checked for                 
tuberculosis.                   

1036
00:46:20,674 --> 00:46:22,040
Increased risk                  
of infections                   

1037
00:46:22,109 --> 00:46:24,342
           and lower ability to 
           fight them may occur.

1038
00:46:24,411 --> 00:46:26,678
Tell your doctor about          
infections, symptoms,           

1039
00:46:26,747 --> 00:46:29,714
or if inflammatory bowel disease
symptoms develop, worsen        

1040
00:46:29,783 --> 00:46:31,950
      or if you've had a        
      vaccine or plan to.       

1041
00:46:32,018 --> 00:46:34,219
Serious allergic                
reactions can occur.            

1042
00:46:34,287 --> 00:46:35,787
     See the possibilities.     

1043
00:46:35,856 --> 00:46:37,822
  Ask your doctor about Taltz.  

1044
00:46:40,726 --> 00:46:41,659
      I remember thinking,      

1045
00:46:41,695 --> 00:46:42,894
  'please God, I hope I don't   

1046
00:46:42,929 --> 00:46:45,597
     meet the Mayor today.'     

1047
00:46:45,632 --> 00:46:47,665
 And in walked Mayor Bloomberg. 

1048
00:46:47,701 --> 00:46:50,201
       Soon as I saw him,       

1049
00:46:50,237 --> 00:46:53,371
    I knew what that meant.     

1050
00:46:53,406 --> 00:46:55,306
 I'm Margaret Brick, and my son 

1051
00:46:55,342 --> 00:46:56,875
      Tommy Brick was the       

1052
00:46:56,910 --> 00:46:58,276
 first firefighter to be killed 

1053
00:46:58,311 --> 00:47:01,412
     in a fire after 9/11.      

1054
00:47:01,448 --> 00:47:03,214
    I said what is going to     

1055
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:05,750
    happen to his children?     

1056
00:47:05,785 --> 00:47:07,085
 Without even skipping a beat,  

1057
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,920
        Mike said to me,        

1058
00:47:08,955 --> 00:47:10,855
 'the fire department will take 

1059
00:47:10,891 --> 00:47:12,524
    good care of those kids,    

1060
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:13,725
       but if they don't,       

1061
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,827
     I will do it myself.'      

1062
00:47:15,862 --> 00:47:17,428
     Every year around the      

1063

  anniversary, Mike calls me.   

1064
00:47:20,467 --> 00:47:22,000
   It's sixteen years later,    

1065
00:47:22,035 --> 00:47:23,167
 to just say I want you to know 

1066
00:47:23,203 --> 00:47:24,235
    I'm thinking about you.     

1067
00:47:24,271 --> 00:47:25,270
       It's just amazing.       

1068
00:47:25,305 --> 00:47:27,005
  He doesn't have to do that.   

1069
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,940
      The Mike I know said      

1070
00:47:28,975 --> 00:47:30,575
  he would never forget Tommy,  

1071
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:32,410
        and he has not.         

1072
00:47:34,848 --> 00:47:36,047
       I'm Mike Bloomberg       

1073
00:47:36,082 --> 00:47:37,649
  and I approve this message.
