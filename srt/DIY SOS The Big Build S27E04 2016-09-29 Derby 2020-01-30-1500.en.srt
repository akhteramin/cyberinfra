     was Rachel's placenta

80
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:39,051

  you was within five minutes

00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:30,028
   Nick: The family are doing   
     their best to manage,      

122
00:05:30,064 --> 00:05:33,999
but every aspect of life at home
      is becoming tougher       

123
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:36,735
 to accommodate Isaac's needs.  

124
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,670
 It's physically getting harder 
          day to day.           

125
00:05:38,706 --> 00:05:40,972
     He's gonna get bigger      
 and bigger, and I'll be scared 

126
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:43,508
       tryin' to get him        
    up and down the stairs.     

127
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:46,812
    Bathin's become an issue    
     for the same reasons.      

128
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,181
  Tryin' to get outside in the  
   garden's a task in itself,   

129
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:50,882
      we've got a big step      
       at the back door,        

130
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:52,617
      none of it's level.       

131
00:05:52,653 --> 00:05:54,920
    The front room's become     
   not just Isaac's bedroom,    

132
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:58,523
       but his playroom,        
    where he has his physio.    

133
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:02,361
  Nick: And because of Isaac's  
 need for round-the-clock care, 

134
00:06:02,396 --> 00:06:05,897
 it's also Dad Andy's bedroom.  

135
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:08,500
    Connie: Mommy and Daddy     
          sleep apart           

136
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,103
      because one of them       
    has to sleep with Isaac     

137
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:15,340
     because, um, sometimes     
     he cries in the night.     

138
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:18,610
    Nick: Rachel has become     
 Isaac's carer in the daytime,  

139
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:21,079
        juggling physio,        
        hospital visits,        

140
00:06:21,115 --> 00:06:22,314
     and his everyday care,     

141
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:24,449
      whilst looking after      
     the rest of the family     

142
00:06:24,485 --> 00:06:27,586
   in a really cramped house.   

143
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:29,821
     Connie: My mum and dad     
       help Isaac a lot.        

144
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:33,325
      He has to have loads      
         of equipment.          

145
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,795
      Rachel: Everythin's       
         on top of us.          

146
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,997
  It creates a lot of pressure  
         after school,          

147
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:40,198
         because Isaac          
      needs to go to bed,       

148
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:42,968
and so the kitchen's essentially
     just become the one--      

149
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:45,270
     we tend to just live,      
     do everythin', really,     

150
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:46,037
        in the kitchen--        

151
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,739
      - Yeah, yeah, we do.      

152
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:49,174
    Rachel: It really does      
    feel like all the walls     

153
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:51,076
      are just closin' in.      

154
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:52,177
         [baby sounds]          

155
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:54,279
  Connie: My mum's just always  
      stuck in the house.       

156
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:57,849
       I think the house        
  is makin' my mum more tired   

157
00:06:57,885 --> 00:06:59,885
     because it's so small.     

158
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,052
    Nick: Not surprisingly,     

159
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:04,589
        the whole family        
     are at breaking point,     

160
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:08,326
   and that's why we're here.   

161
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:11,930
 All right, so what do you need 
     us to do to the house?     

162
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:16,902
 - It's about givin' Isaac his  
sp-- his own space and dignity, 

163
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,471
 and for the house to function  
     for a family of five.      

164
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:20,972
 Rachel: Just bein' able to do  
    just something normal,      

165
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:22,607
   like watch a bit of telly    
    at weekends and just--      

166
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:24,242
 and a bit of a place to go to  
       to relax, really,        

167
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:27,646
'cause obviously Isaac's bedroom
      is our living room.       

168
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:28,747
  Nick: The house is fighting   
    against you, basically.     

169
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:29,815
         Rachel: Yeah.          

170
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:30,949
    Nick: If we can get this    
         turned around          

171
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:33,652
 to the house that you actually 
      need for the family,      

172
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:34,953
   a big change in lifestyle?   

173
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:36,221
     Rachel: It would take      
    a massive pressure off,     

174
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:38,623
   especially me, day-to-day.   

175
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:39,157
          Nick: Okay.           

176
00:07:39,193 --> 00:07:40,258
      There's a lot to do,      

177
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:42,327
    so we are going to have     
  to destroy your family home   

178
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:44,429
      in order to give you      
the home that you want, I think.

179
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:45,063
             Ready?             

180
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:46,398
       - Yeah. Thank you.       

181
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:48,567
- Plus, she looks like she wants
 to tell a story or something.  

182
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:50,936
    You chatted all the way     
   through that, didn't you?    

183
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,304
You are possibly the chattiest--

184
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:53,972
         [baby sounds]          

185
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:55,040
I can't get a word in edgewise, 

186
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:56,541
        and that doesn't        
       happen very often.       

187
00:07:56,577 --> 00:07:59,478
           [laughing]           

188
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:02,280
    Despite the brave faces,    
     things need to change.     

189
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:06,551
Luckily, this lot thinks so too.

190
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:07,219
    Good morning, everybody.    

191
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:08,119
    Everyone: Good morning.     

192
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,187
      Nick: There you go,       
         see they're--          

193
00:08:09,223 --> 00:08:10,489
   they're all very friendly.   

194
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:11,490
   We need to get you going,    

195
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:12,624
        because we need         
 to let these guys at the house 

196
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:15,293
      and don't come back       
   over the next three days,    

197
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:16,895
   because it will be really,   
       really upsetting.        

198
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,331
           [laughing]           

199
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:23,068
         He's giggling!         

200
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:25,670
  So, it's ta-ra to the Smiths  

201
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:28,974
     and hello to this lot      
     of Prince Charmings.       

202
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,108
             Yeah.              

203
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:32,544
 - Okay lads, you take the back 
    there and get in there.     

204
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:33,445
     - Go and have yourself     
         a look at it,          

205
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,412
        we'll come out          
   and join you in a minute.    

206
00:08:34,448 --> 00:08:36,581
       Nick: And they're        
       straight in there,       

207
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:37,782
    and that's no bad thing,    

208
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:41,019
  because completing the job    
  in nine days is never easy.   

209
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:43,355
    In fact, it's ludicrous.    

210
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,589
        It's busy, look.        

211
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,491
          [chuckling]           

212
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:48,226
      This is the only way      
       we stand a chance        

213
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:49,094
      of getting it done.       

214
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:50,862
  Hit it hard and tear it out.  

215
00:08:50,898 --> 00:08:52,964
  "Rip it up and start again."  

216
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,433
  No, we won't play that song,  
         it's too old.          

217
00:08:55,469 --> 00:08:56,601
   But as well as destroying,   

218
00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:58,503
          these guys            
    have to build, quickly.     

219
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:01,273
 A whole timber frame extension 
     by the end of the day.     

220
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:04,643
 What saith you, Mr. Perryman?  

221
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:05,544
         Ah yeah, easy.         

222
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:07,812
      Maybe. By lunchtime.      

223
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:09,047
           [laughing]

   - Them pills are workin'.    

225
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:10,916
    - He's great, isn't he?     

226
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:12,918
      He's Mr. Enthusiasm.      

227
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:16,454
     There are another 80       
enthusiastic people here today, 

228
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,523
 following the meticulous plan  

229
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:21,159
    laid out by our designer    
            du jour.

231
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:27,132
         Meet Big Dave.         

232
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:28,033
     Just fooling with you.     

233
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:31,236
        It's of course          
   the lovely Julia Kendell.    

234
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:33,939
     Although, I'm not sure     
      about the pick axe.       

235
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:36,408
  Slightly terrifying, innit?   

236
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:38,043
          These houses          
      are actually lovely.      

237
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,445
   I mean, beautifully built    
       miner's cottages.        

238
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,379
     - They are beautiful.      

239
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:42,447
       - And we're gonna        
         mess them up.

241
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:45,984
- Well, we're completely ripping
  the guts out of this place.   

242
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:46,952
            - Yeah.             

243
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:48,053
      - The reason being        
     we have got to create

00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:51,089
      for the whole family      
     a wonderful, big space     

245
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:53,024
     that's easy for Rachel     
     to be able to navigate     

246
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,893
    with a wheelchair, and--    
       and just somewhere       

247
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,395
  that's got a fantastic sense  
   of vibrancy and positivity   

248
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:59,064
        about it again.         

249
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,199
     Nick: Scrubs up well       
  for a builder, doesn't she?   

250
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:04,169
 Julia's design has us removing 
  most of the walls downstairs  

251
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:07,038
      to create that sense      
       of space and flow,       

252
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:08,273
     starting with the old      
         living room,           

253
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:12,277
  which we'll turn into a new   
bedroom and wet room for Isaac. 

254
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:14,946
The old galley kitchen is going,
         in its place,          

255
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:18,049
           a spacious           
    kitchen-cum-dining area,    

256
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:19,184
 and at the back of the house,  

257
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:20,986
       we're constructing       
    a timber frame extension    

258
00:10:21,021 --> 00:10:25,090
    on existing foundations     
to create a comfortable lounge. 

259
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,891
   Right, let's pop upstairs.   

260
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:29,594
  Here, we're widening the old  
    claustrophobic hallway,     

261
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,997
 remodeling the family bathroom 
         and bedrooms,          

262
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:33,999
    and we'll be installing     
      a monitoring system       

263
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:36,601
      for Rachel and Andy       
  so that sleeping downstairs   

264
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:39,270
         on a mattress          
  will be a thing of the past.  

265
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:40,538
     Julia: I mean, they're     
     a great team together,     

266
00:10:40,574 --> 00:10:41,506
         but, you know,         

267
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,708
    they need to be a couple    
      together again now.       

268
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:44,776
          Nick: Yeah.           

269
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,611
     - Um, so I think in--      
   in doing what we're doing,   

270
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:47,746
  we're going to create a home  

271
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:52,484
   that really does allow her   
   to breathe again, I think.   

272
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:53,652
     Chris: Come on, boys.      

273
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:54,786
     Nick: To achieve this,     

274
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:58,356
    Chris is sending a crew     
 of 30 to destroy the upstairs  

275
00:10:58,392 --> 00:11:03,028
  and 50 downstairs to remove   
    all the internal walls.     

276
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:04,863
We're literally tearing it apart

277
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:06,665
        quicker than we         
       can get rid of it.       

278
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,366
     And Truck-it-in Skips.     

279
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:11,970
 Now tell me this bloke doesn't 
    look like John Prescott.    

280
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,705
     - How you doing, mate?     

281
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,806
        Nice to see ya.         

282
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:15,573
            - Yeah.             

283
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:16,841
 - You're here to save the day. 

284
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:20,111
    Nick: But the workload's    
    not worrying him or her,    

285
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:21,212
     because we're working      
      with skilled people       

286
00:11:21,248 --> 00:11:23,348
       that know exactly        
      what they're doing.       

287
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:25,216
           And Billy.           

288
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:26,284
     Billy: What I'm doing      

289
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:28,720
       is I'm getting rid       
     of all the old cables.     

290
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:31,022
   Unfortunately, they've run   
        some new ones in        

291
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:33,191
     and I got rid of them      
         as well, but.          

292
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:34,759
        Nick: Pilchard.         

293
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:36,928
 Unbelievably, the timber frame 
    extension is almost up,     

294
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:43,034
    making the floor space      
 downstairs bigger by a third.  

295
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,369
         Why is there           
      a double truss here       

296
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:46,504
    and why are these little    
      extensions in here?       

297
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,207
  - Oh, we just had some extra  
  stuff that we had to use up.  

298
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:52,844
           [laughing]           

299
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,813
   Nick: At the back, we're     
   stripping the old garden,    

300
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:58,450
       which is massive,        
  a colossal 29 metres by 10.   

301
00:11:58,485 --> 00:12:02,754
        Luckily, that's         
      Julian's territory.       

302
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:03,822
       Wait, look, look,        
      look through there.       

303
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:05,223
 Look, look who's got his feet  
        under the table         

304
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:05,857
       with the neighbor?       

305
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:06,858
        A cup of coffee.        

306
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:07,959
     Mark: Oh my goodness.      

307
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:10,929
       - Choccie biscuit,       
    conversation in the sun.    

308
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:13,565
    Which is no bad thing,      
  because access is an issue,   

309
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,666
    so the lovely neighbors     

310
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:16,801
        have allowed us         
   to destroy their fencing.    

311
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:19,604
      That's nice, innit?       

312
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:22,173
     Julian: The neighbors      
  the house up on the corner--  

313
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:23,041
            - Yeah.             

314
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,309
         - That was the         
     knocker-upper's house.     

315
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:27,378
  He says he has a big stick    
with like a knocker on the end, 

316
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:30,115
  and he walks up the street,   
   bangs everybody's doors,     

317
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,850
        up, back down,          
   get everybody out of bed.    

318
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:34,185
      - But what happens        
     if you're already up?      

319
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:36,588
     The missus wouldn't be     
     too happy, would she?      

320
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:38,323
  Nick: Do you want to finish   
  this section off for us now   

321
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:40,125
       so we can move on        
       to something else?       

322
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,426
  - We should go over to Jules  

323
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:44,662
     and see how he's doing     
         in the garden.         

324
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:45,463
    - I'm not in the garden,    
           I'm here.            

325
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:47,732
- We won't go over to see Jules.

326
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:48,933
           [laughing]           

327
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:51,469
  Nick: Imagine, you have him   
    for one hour this week,     

328
00:12:51,505 --> 00:12:54,672
  we've had him for 16 years.   

329
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,708
        - Oh, done that.        

330
00:12:56,743 --> 00:12:59,144
        Nick: Out back,         
  the activity has picked up,   

331
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:00,779
        and what we need        
       is a creative plan       

332
00:13:00,814 --> 00:13:02,547
    for this colossal space.    

333
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:06,317
        Luckily, Julia          
     has come up with one.      

334
00:13:06,353 --> 00:13:08,186
       The design marries       
        both the family         

335
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:11,556
        and Isaac's need        
    for sensory stimulation.    

336
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:14,359
    We'll be sourcing around    
     100 railway sleepers,      

337
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:17,028
 which will frame an artificial 
         grass descent,         

338
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:19,697
  with sweet-smelling borders   
     and rustling plants.       

339
00:13:19,733 --> 00:13:20,799
         At the bottom,         

340
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:23,601
   a much-needed therapy hut    
        with hydro pool         

341
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:26,938
     so Isaac can stretch       
and work his muscles every day. 

342
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:31,376
     It's impressive, but,      
 to be honest, very ambitious.  

343
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:34,779
  - It's gonna be so stunning   
    if we ever get it done.     

344
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:37,415
        So there is heck        
        of a lot to do.         

345
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,150
        Nick: That's an         
        understatement.         

346
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:42,954
 - C'mon, lads, let's have it.  

347
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,989
    Nick: Right, we'll start    
 with the ten tonne of concrete 

348
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:48,760
  required for the hydro pool   
       room foundations.        

349
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:50,662
  - Going on there, going on.   

350
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:53,464
     Nick: Therapy is vital     
to Isaac's health and happiness,

351
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,467
but he currently only has access
       to it twice a week       

352
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,636
   at his specialist school,    

353
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:02,640
    and you're about to see     
 just how much it means to him. 

354
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:04,008
  Rachel: We still don't know   
        a lot ourselves         

355
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:05,810
    about what the future's     
     gonna hold, you know,      

356
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:09,080
        in terms of what        
 his development's going to be. 

357
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:10,849
- He's giggling a lot, isn't he?

358
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:14,052
           [giggling]           

359
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:15,186
         Rachel: He has         
      a vision impairment,      

360
00:14:15,222 --> 00:14:16,454
  we don't know to what extent  

361
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:18,823
 the images are sort of comin'  
 into his brain if he likes--   

362
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:20,592
   strugglin' to be processed   

363
00:14:20,627 --> 00:14:22,193
  because of his brain damage,  
           basically.           

364
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:25,763
 Therapist: You see a lot, that 
     one, well done, Isaac.     

365
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:29,334
 Rachel: Any therapy we do with 
 him helps with his condition.  

366
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,636
Therapist: A lot of red lights. 

367
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:34,138
       That's very good.        

368
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:36,641
   He catches where they are.   

369
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:38,810
  Isaac is absolutely a dream.  

370
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:42,513
  He's a very happy young boy,  
         very sociable.         

371
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:44,883
   He needs the environments    
      to be right for him       

372
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:48,553
     so that he can develop     
        all his senses.         

373
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:51,823
     He needs stimulation.      

374
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:54,492
    I mean, Isaac absolutely    
    loves swimmin' as well,     

375
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:57,662
 so somethin' to do to give him 
   an opportunity with water    

376
00:14:57,697 --> 00:15:00,331
        would be lovely.        

377
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:03,501
       Oh, good, lovely.        

378
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:05,270
  Rachel: I try to take things  
       one day at a time,       

379
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:08,039
      I try and not think       
         too far ahead.         

380
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,107
We just want to try and help him

381
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:11,142
          be the best           
    that he can be, really.     

382
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:13,378
           [giggling]           

383
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:15,213
        Nick: And that's        
   what we want to do for him   

384
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:18,116
        in his own home.        

385
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:20,285
    Unfortunately, the house    
   is currently being held up   

386
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,453
like a melon on cocktail sticks,

387
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:24,555
      so it's time to get       
     some strength back in      

388
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:26,357
       with steel joists.       

389
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:28,793
  And what we need is someone   
    intelligent to explain      

390
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:31,362
     what's happening here.     

391
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:32,497
        What's going on         
        at the moment?          

392
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:33,898
   Somebody needs to explain    
       what's going on.         

393
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:35,066
 Julian: They're lifting it up. 

394
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,801
        Nick: I can see         
     they're lifting it up.     

395
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:38,036
      Don't patronize me.       

396
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:40,638
  - They're doing it the, um,   
        Egyptian style.         

397
00:15:40,674 --> 00:15:41,739
    - Murdering each other.     

398
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,775
 What have the Egyptians done?  

399
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,511
     - When you're setting      
    a massive piece of stone    

400
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:48,846
      you place it on ice,      

401
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:51,749
 so you can get the straps out  
       and the ice melts        

402
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:55,687
         and it slowly          
     goes down into place.      

403
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:57,488
     - How do they make ice     
           in Egypt?            

404
00:15:57,524 --> 00:15:59,357
   - Well, that's what I was    
         going to say.          

405
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:00,291
  I didn't know whether it was  
         the Egyptians,         

406
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:02,060
  but it was somebody done it.  

407
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:03,895
- It's like talking to a walking
  encyclopedia, really, innit.  

408
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:08,733
        An encyclopedia         
     that's lost the index.     

409
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:12,236
    This is steel number two    
       of five to go in,        

410
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:17,475
    all donated to the build    
     by our lovely trades.      

411
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,043
  You got a three or four-hour  
    turnaround for us there     

412
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:20,311
         on the steels,         
      thank you very much.      

413
00:16:20,347 --> 00:16:21,446
- Yeah, that's no worries, mate.

414
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:22,447
     - Well, and it's a lot     
     of money's worth too,      

415
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,015
    so why have you decided     
     to join and help out?      

416
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,150
- Um, my sister's got a daughter

417
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:28,920
       who basically got        
        cerebral palsy,         

418
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:31,222
       um, they give her        
        a week to live.         

419
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:33,191
    Um, she's still here now    
      and she's fightin',       

420
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:36,027
       and she's what 28        
      the other week, so,       

421
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:38,229
   that's going week to week,   
              so--              

422
00:16:38,264 --> 00:16:38,963
             - Wow.             

423
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:40,665
- she's doing really well.      

424
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,301
     The lads have all          
contributed their time, so.     

425
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:44,569
       For a good cause.        

426
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:45,670
         - Brilliant.           

427
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:46,738
Well, look, we really appreciate
      you joining as well.      

428
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:47,672
           Thank you.           

429
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:48,639
     Julian: See you again      
        in the morning.         

430
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:49,440
    Nick: All right, see you    
       tomorrow morning.        

431
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:51,509
      Thank you very much.      

432
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:52,810
         Out the back,          

433
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:55,546
   the guys are now tamping     
   the concrete foundations,    

434
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:56,381
    which should set in time    

435
00:16:56,416 --> 00:17:01,019
        for a big push          
    in the garden tomorrow.     

436
00:17:01,054 --> 00:17:02,020
    What a day, what a day,     

437
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:03,888
    and all the house is now    
    held up on acrow props,     

438
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:06,057
 because we've taken walls out  
 and put new steels in there,   

439
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:08,059
      new steels in here,       
      a new window there,       

440
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:09,160
      in fact, new windows      
      all around the house      

441
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:10,628
    apart from two windows.     

442
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:12,263
        A chimney breast        
        taken out there,        

443
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:13,731
 through the acrow props again, 

444
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:15,633
      grooves in the floor      
         for drainage,          

445
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:17,869
 through more acrow props which 
 hold up the back of the house, 

446
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:19,037
because it isn't there anymore, 

447
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:20,605
          because this          
      is the new extension      

448
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,473
  with a new roof on already,   
    look at the size of it.     

449
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:24,275
      It's just fantastic.      

450
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,343
  Back through the acrow props  

451
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,011
 to a doorway that wasn't here  
         this morning.          

452
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:27,979
Oh, and we've made a good start 

453
00:17:28,014 --> 00:17:30,114
       on the electrics         
       and the plumbing.        

454
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,250
          Not bad, eh?          

455
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:33,885
   Tomorrow, we'll get busy.    

456
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,426
         Good morning.          

457
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:42,193
    A little bit too close?     

458
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:43,394
           All right.           

459
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,929
         Yesterday was          
       a magnificent day.       

460
00:17:44,964 --> 00:17:47,632
    I feel today is gonna be    
      equally magnificent,      

461
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,467
  although we are facing a bit  
    of an issue with access     

462
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:51,469
   and egress to the garden.    

463
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:54,539
   We'll work it out though.    

464
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,207
    Yesterday we cleared out    
       the old backyard,        

465
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,975
         or bomb site,          
     as we like to call it,     

466
00:17:58,011 --> 00:17:59,577
       so today, it's on        
       to the hard graft        

467
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:02,914
       constructing our         
     ambitious new garden.      

468
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:05,650
 Man: Well, all this area here  
is going to be artificial grass.

469
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:06,617
            - Yeah.             

470
00:18:06,653 --> 00:18:07,351
      - So all this grass       
      has got to come off,      

471
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:08,786
  the top has got to come off.  

472
00:18:08,822 --> 00:18:10,988
       Nick: Landscaping        
    almost 300 square metres    

473
00:18:11,024 --> 00:18:12,890
is frankly a big ask from Julia,

474
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:14,926
   but I have to say it's not   
     worrying Farmer Giles.     

475
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:16,194
      Sorry. Farmer Jules.

00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,204
         Nick: Or Mark.         

480
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:27,305
   But it is affecting Billy.   

481
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:30,675
  He's none too happy, as I've  
    dabbled with his wiring.    

482
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,043
    Billy: They filled it in    
       with the concrete,       

483
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:34,245
        and they forgot         
       to put the pipe--        

484
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,680
Nick: Well, I asked them not to.

485
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:36,547
      - But you shouldn't.      

486
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:37,915

00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,584
   it goes up on the outside    
       of the building.         

488
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,186
  Billy: The parties that are   
  involved must be informed,    

489
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:44,555
     not someone come along     
        and say, "We--"         

490
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:46,858
          Don't, Mark.          

491
00:18:46,893 --> 00:18:48,426
      We don't need people      
    coming along and saying,    

492
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,161
     "Well, we ain't gonna      
       put it in there."        

493
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:51,362
       Don't belittle us!       

494
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:52,363
       You're belittling!       

495
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:52,964
      - Who's belittling?       

496
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:53,631
           - You are!           
           - I'm not!           

497
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:54,565
     We don't want cuddles.     

498
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:56,467
         We just want           
       to get it sorted.        

499
00:18:56,503 --> 00:18:57,768
        Nick: You might         
         want a cuddle?         

500
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:58,803
         - He doesn't,          
     I don't need a cuddle.     

501
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:03,007
     No, I'm upset because      
      no one involved us.       

502
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:07,745
  We do it for a reason, this,  
     not to be underminded.     

503
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:11,682
     And that's what we've      
    been done, underminded.     

504
00:19:11,718 --> 00:19:13,050
         - Underminded?         

505
00:19:13,086 --> 00:19:15,286
           [laughing]           

506
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:18,823
I think for the next few hours, 
   Billy is best left alone,    

507
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:21,092
         or avoided-ed.         

508
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:22,059
     In the house upstairs,     

509
00:19:22,095 --> 00:19:24,996
     the wall stud himself,     
         Mr. Frediani,          

510
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:25,930
  along with some new buddies   

511
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:27,832
       are busy changing        
     the room configuration     

512
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:31,269
  so they feel more spacious.   

513
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:32,970
       Man: I just wanna        
     pick these bricks up.      

514
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:33,838
            - Yeah.             

515
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:36,707
       - They're floating       
       in no man's land.        

516
00:19:36,743 --> 00:19:39,577
     Nick: Nothing is being     
        left to chance.         

517
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:40,978
   Now, since Isaac's birth,    

518
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:43,481
     Dad Andy hasn't slept      
    in the bedroom upstairs,    

519
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,283
       but on a mattress        
      in the living room,       

520
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:47,151
     so he can keep an eye      
          on his son,           

521
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:48,553
         and that has           
    to have taken its toll.     

522
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:51,155
           You're one           
    of the world's worriers.    

523
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:52,256
   - I am a world's worrier.    

524
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:53,191
         I don't know           
       if I'm the worst,        

525
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:54,458
but I'm certainly not the best. 

526
00:19:54,494 --> 00:19:55,560
           [laughing]           

527
00:19:55,595 --> 00:19:56,961
  I worry about things that--   

528
00:19:56,996 --> 00:19:58,629
         that I can't           
    have an influence over,     

529
00:19:58,665 --> 00:20:00,965
      but that being said,      
  it doesn't stop me worrying.  

530
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,503
     The big thing is Isaac     
and the kids, Connie and Violet.

531
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:07,972
         How they deal          
 with the family life that's--  

532
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:11,175
that they've been brought into. 

533
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:12,443
       Connie, with her,        

534
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:14,312
she's dealing with adapting to  
    Isaac, 'cause she's--       

535
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:16,380
          her brother,          
    with the needs he's got.    

536
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:21,319
Isaac, for the first six months 
   of his life, is in pain,     

537
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:24,288
        abdominal spasms        
       and muscle spasms.       

538
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:25,923
    And the impact was huge.    

539
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:27,191
 When he was still in hospital, 

540
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:32,863
she drew a picture and stuck it 
on his bedroom wall, and that-- 

541
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:35,833
     that upset me, because     
 she drew him with a big smile, 

542
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:38,736
       saying he's cute.        

543
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:40,071
        Within two weeks        
       of him being home,       

544
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:42,139
   she drew another picture,    
   and it had a big sad face,   

545
00:20:42,175 --> 00:20:45,209
  because he's always crying,   
    I don't want him here.      

546
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:47,245
 And that's really tough, too.  

547
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,448
        I do worry about        
      how tough, mentally,      

548
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:53,084
   she has to be at her age.    

549
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,252
        - Do you worry          
       about the future,        

550
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:55,753
 or try not to think about it?  

551
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:57,555
      - It does scare me.       

552
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,857
   There is a life expectancy   
         for all of us.         

553
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:02,326
 Isaac's has been compromised,  

554
00:21:02,362 --> 00:21:04,695
       but we don't know        
         by how much.           

555
00:21:04,731 --> 00:21:08,499
   And once that's been said    
to you, how do you deal with it?

556
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:09,634
      - This kind of thing      

557
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:11,569
  will put a massive pressure   
    on your relationships,      

558
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,237
    and it has to have done,    
    the stress, the strain,     

559
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:15,239
           the worry,           
     the sleep deprivation.     

560
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:22,380
- I've seen Rachel when she's-- 
  that strength isn't there.    

561
00:21:22,415 --> 00:21:24,015
     And I guess that's one     
     of the worries that--      

562
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:26,050
  that might become the norm.   

563
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:29,253
        I do think a lot        
       of Rachel at home,       

564
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:31,289
    and wanting to be there     
        to help her out         

565
00:21:31,324 --> 00:21:34,358
         with pressures         
     of dealing with Isaac.     

566
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:38,195
         We have drawn          
   on a strong relationship.    

567
00:21:38,231 --> 00:21:43,301
    And I think the value--     
    the value of that to me     

568
00:21:43,336 --> 00:21:45,469
 has made me worry a bit more,  
'cause I don't want to lose it. 

569
00:21:45,505 --> 00:21:49,907
    You know, I've worried      
 that the stress is gonna be--  

570
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:52,009
     reach breaking point.      

571
00:21:52,045 --> 00:21:54,045
        To have Rachel          
       in an environment        

572
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,246
     that is a stress-free,     

573
00:21:55,281 --> 00:21:57,915
    that's one less stress      
 that's on Rachel's shoulders.  

574
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,117
  That will hopefully have a--  

575
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:02,153
   a release of the pressure    
          all 'round,           

576
00:22:02,188 --> 00:22:05,323
     from the relationship      
  point of view on the family.  

577
00:22:05,358 --> 00:22:07,124
  - And you're still obviously  
  very much in love with her?   

578
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,526
           - Oh yeah.           

579
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:13,297
     'Cause she is just a--     
         she's amazing.         

580
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:14,999
     Nick: It's clear to me     

581
00:22:15,034 --> 00:22:16,767
   that the work we're doing    
         on the house           

582
00:22:16,803 --> 00:22:19,870
     won't just help ease       
   the situation with Isaac,    

583
00:22:19,906 --> 00:22:24,108
   but relieve the pressure     
   for Andy and Rachel, too.    

584
00:22:24,143 --> 00:22:25,910
       There is, however,       
       a slight problem.        

585
00:22:25,945 --> 00:22:27,244
         We're getting          
      numerous deliveries,      

586
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,413
 but none of them are carrying  
      the key ingredient        

587
00:22:29,449 --> 00:22:34,485
      required for Julia's      
      epic garden design.       

588
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,286
     - Okay, not to worry.      

589
00:22:35,321 --> 00:22:36,687
    Yeah, no, I understand.     

590
00:22:36,723 --> 00:22:37,988
             Okay.              

591
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:40,691
      Nick: She wants 100       
   straight railway sleepers    

592
00:22:40,727 --> 00:22:43,361
  to cut into circular paths.   

593
00:22:43,396 --> 00:22:46,063
     - I'm so keen to keep      
   the shape that we've got,    

594
00:22:46,099 --> 00:22:47,631
because I think it's gonna work 
        so beautifully,         

595
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:50,835
   so I'm gonna have to amend   
    the design a little bit.    

596
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:51,969
  - Eighty-two treated joists.  

597
00:22:52,004 --> 00:22:54,472
       - Treated joists,        
      about 40 metres off,      

598
00:22:54,507 --> 00:22:55,539
     rather than sleepers.      

599
00:22:55,575 --> 00:22:56,507
      - If we can get 50,       

600
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:57,408
       then it allows us        
    a little bit of leeway.     

601
00:22:57,443 --> 00:22:58,943
  - I shall see what I can do.  

602
00:22:58,978 --> 00:23:00,111
           Nick: Hm.            

603
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:03,214
      An eight-inch-by-two      
    rectangular wooden block    

604
00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:05,816
  doesn't sound very circular.  

605
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:08,285
      Eight-by-two joists       
   will not give you a curve.   

606
00:23:08,321 --> 00:23:10,354
 Julia: Well, according to my,  
  uh, my garden specialists,    

607
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,522
   who happen to be experts--   

608
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:12,690
      - But you just said       

609
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:13,958
      they're going to try      
  and get eight-by-two joists.  

610
00:23:13,993 --> 00:23:16,994
      Man: But she liked        
   the feature of the timber    

611
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:17,695
     sticking out the back.     

612
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,529
        - Oh, goodness.         

613
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:19,764
     But she's designing--      
        at some stage,          

614
00:23:19,832 --> 00:23:21,632
        we've got to go,        
        "That's enough."        

615
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:23,601
        - We've changed.        

616
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:24,668
 - We listen to the designer--  

617
00:23:24,704 --> 00:23:26,904
   - As opposed to listening    
     to the TV presenter?       

618
00:23:26,939 --> 00:23:28,973
      You know, come on,        
    I am here for a reason,     

619
00:23:29,008 --> 00:23:31,742
 to make it all look wonderful  
  and for it to work, surely.   

620
00:23:31,778 --> 00:23:32,710
          - You know,           

621
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:33,677
      there comes a point       
    where you've got to say,    

622
00:23:33,713 --> 00:23:35,746
        well, we're not         
  gonna achieve that, are we?   

623
00:23:35,782 --> 00:23:37,748
Julia: Yeah, but we're not quite
   at that point yet, though.   

624
00:23:37,784 --> 00:23:38,949
       - It's achievable.       

625
00:23:38,985 --> 00:23:39,650
          - Thank you.          

626
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,923
  Before I had a conversation   
          with Nick,            

627
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:47,258
  I was quite happy, actually,  

628
00:23:47,293 --> 00:23:49,460
  just so long as it ended up   
 working the way that I wanted, 

629
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:51,262
     but now that we've had     
       that conversation,       

630
00:23:51,297 --> 00:23:54,732
 I'm absolutely determined that 
it's gonna be finished, frankly.

631
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,267
      Nick: Fighting talk       
      from Kendell there,       

632
00:23:56,302 --> 00:23:58,235
     who used to be a boxer     
      when she was a man.       

633
00:23:58,271 --> 00:24:00,638
 There's one bit of the garden  
    design I am happy with.     

634
00:24:00,673 --> 00:24:01,705
         When it's up,          

635
00:24:01,741 --> 00:24:04,041
   the therapy hut will house   
    a hydro pool and hoist,     

636
00:24:04,076 --> 00:24:06,811
  which means more electrics.   

637
00:24:06,846 --> 00:24:10,181
    - We've wired upstairs,     
    sparks to the bathroom.     

638
00:24:10,216 --> 00:24:11,515
    Nick: Billy and his team    
         are installing         

639
00:24:11,551 --> 00:24:15,486
over 1,000 metres of electrical 
     cable in this build,       

640
00:24:15,521 --> 00:24:17,721
 which is a big responsibility. 

641
00:24:17,757 --> 00:24:19,223
  - We just found two cables.   

642
00:24:19,258 --> 00:24:21,058
      We're just wondering      
         where they go.         

643
00:24:21,093 --> 00:24:22,026
           [laughing]           

644
00:24:22,061 --> 00:24:22,827
     Nick: Well, you can't      
      win them all, Bill.       

645
00:24:22,862 --> 00:24:24,929
   Something won't switch on.   

646
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:27,064
         We're winning          
in the old living room, however,

647
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:31,602
as the timber frame for Isaac's 
     wet room has emerged.      

648
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:35,639
    And the boys on the roof    
      have been very busy.      

649
00:24:35,675 --> 00:24:36,674
       What do you make         
      of this site, then?       

650
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:38,209
   'Cause it's kind of weird    
     and different and...       

651
00:24:38,244 --> 00:24:39,543
       - Yeah, it's busy.       

652
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:41,345
    I've never seen so many     
        blokes on site.         

653
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,414
  It's nice, we've got so many  
     people all of the time     

654
00:24:43,449 --> 00:24:44,882
   who want to do-- you know.   

655
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:46,050
- Sometimes you give money      
      to charities,             

656
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:46,951
 you don't know where it goes,  

657
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:48,786
   this you can actually see,   
          physically,           

658
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:51,722
   what a difference you're     
  making for somebody's life.   

659
00:24:51,757 --> 00:24:54,892
Nick: This big fella', is he one
          of your lot?          

660
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:55,326
         - That's John.         

661
00:24:55,361 --> 00:24:55,960
        - I'm granddad.         

662
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:56,827
     Man: That's granddad.      

663
00:24:56,863 --> 00:24:57,394
      Nick: Is that right?      

664
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,229
     Man: My father-in-law.     

665
00:24:58,264 --> 00:24:59,630
      Nick: Is that right?      

666
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:00,931
    Man: He's the godfather     
           of faces.            

667
00:25:00,967 --> 00:25:02,433
   Nick: Godfather of faces.    

668
00:25:02,468 --> 00:25:04,001
         - Yeah, yeah.          

669
00:25:04,036 --> 00:25:05,436
           [laughing]           

670
00:25:05,471 --> 00:25:07,271
     Nick: And Chris's team     
     should feel very proud     

671
00:25:07,306 --> 00:25:10,774
     of their performances      
        in the bedroom.         

672
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:12,676
    Chris: Well, basically,     
   we've had to join this in,   

673
00:25:12,712 --> 00:25:14,812
        we've replaced          
     all the rotten walls,      

674
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:17,014
ready for a big my day tomorrow.

675
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:18,315
  The plasterers will be here,  

676
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:21,285
 and we can start putting this  
little baby back together again.

677
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,288
   Nick: Now that's an offer    
       we can't refuse.         

678
00:25:24,323 --> 00:25:29,093
 [playing The Godfather Waltz,  
       from Il Padrino]         

679
00:25:29,128 --> 00:25:31,362
  He really is the godfather.   

680
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:37,902
  It's our third day on site,   

681
00:25:37,937 --> 00:25:41,138
   and it's centerstage for     
Mr. Frediani's favourite trade, 

682
00:25:41,173 --> 00:25:44,875
       a veritable spread       
         of plasterers.         

683
00:25:44,911 --> 00:25:45,609
           - My boys!           

684
00:25:45,645 --> 00:25:46,877
       Look at 'em, that.       

685
00:25:46,913 --> 00:25:48,379
 They're like ants all over it. 

686
00:25:48,414 --> 00:25:50,247
  So, a couple rolls of scrim   
          up on these.          

687
00:25:50,283 --> 00:25:51,515
   Nick: Big hands, mind you.   

688
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:53,384
     Rachel felt the walls      
    were closing in on her,     

689
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:54,418
     so Chris and the boys      

690
00:25:54,453 --> 00:25:56,353
     have been working on       
   getting the upstairs area    

691
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:59,623
      feeling and looking       
        more spacious.          

692
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:01,125
           [drilling]           

693
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,393
        Man: Beautiful.         

694
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:05,996
- We've just pushed these walls 
out to give more access up here,

695
00:26:06,032 --> 00:26:09,099
   so they're gonna re-board    
 and then re-skim the upstairs, 

696
00:26:09,135 --> 00:26:10,834
      giving the sparkies       
        and the plumber         

697
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:13,437
        time downstairs         
  to finish the kitchen area,   

698
00:26:13,472 --> 00:26:14,505
      but I'm very excited      

699
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,674
     'cause there's about       
    16 plasterers on board,     

700
00:26:16,709 --> 00:26:17,975
       and I've only got        
      the upstairs to do,       

701
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:20,344
      so they'll eat this.      

702
00:26:20,379 --> 00:26:21,412
            - Nice.             

703
00:26:21,447 --> 00:26:23,514
       Nick: Christopher        
     is a happy work bunny,     

704
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:25,316
      but after Cablegate,      

705
00:26:25,351 --> 00:26:28,218
     I'm approaching Billy      
     with extreme caution.      

706
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:29,753
         Am I allowed           
       to hug you today?        

707
00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:31,855
   - Hey! Of course you are!    

708
00:26:31,891 --> 00:26:33,991
That's all forgotten, that's all
      forgotten, sausage.       

709
00:26:34,026 --> 00:26:35,292
      Nick: I have to say,      

710
00:26:35,328 --> 00:26:37,795
         I'm sorry that         
       I underminded you.       

711
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:42,333
     - Oh, uh, it's a long,     
           it's um...           

712
00:26:42,368 --> 00:26:43,634
  What am I going to say now?   

713
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:45,035
           [laughing]           

714
00:26:45,071 --> 00:26:46,837
Nick: Aw, he's all totes emosh. 

715
00:26:46,872 --> 00:26:49,873
 Outside, they're bricking it,  
      and in the garden,        

716
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:51,942
     someone's digging it,      
     having a lovely time,      

717
00:26:51,978 --> 00:26:57,047
          courtesy of           
     a three-tonne machine.     

718
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:58,349
    - Could I get a bit more    
           over here?           

719
00:26:58,384 --> 00:26:59,350
        - Yeah, please.         

720
00:26:59,385 --> 00:27:00,751
       Nick: But despite        
         my reasonably          

721
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,319
         and politely           
     explained objections,      

722
00:27:02,355 --> 00:27:05,789
Julia is refusing to scale back 
     on the garden design,      

723
00:27:05,825 --> 00:27:09,259
  which is putting these guys   
        under pressure.         

724
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:12,696
    Man: We're-- we're, uh,     
we're on top of it, we're uh... 

725
00:27:12,732 --> 00:27:13,864
Like I say, we're getting there.

726
00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:15,032
        Nick: All right,        
   enjoy the rest of the day,   

727
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:16,600
     and I'll try to keep       
  the designer away from you.   

728
00:27:16,636 --> 00:27:19,536
           [laughing]           

729
00:27:19,572 --> 00:27:21,205
         At the bottom          
  of the controversial slope,   

730
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,773
     the therapy hut is up,     
       and I have to say,       

731
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:24,608
     is looking fantastic.      

732
00:27:24,644 --> 00:27:26,477
        It's being clad         
       in natural cedar,        

733
00:27:26,512 --> 00:27:29,680
  which is hard-wearing and,    
 by the way, smells fantastic.  

734
00:27:29,715 --> 00:27:31,281
     I wish you could have      
   a scratch-and-sniff telly    

735
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:34,018
 so you could smell this cedar. 

736
00:27:34,053 --> 00:27:35,352
     It's really beautiful,     
          very lovely.          

737
00:27:35,388 --> 00:27:36,520
      It's pretty, innit?       

738
00:27:36,555 --> 00:27:39,523
            - Yeah.             

739
00:27:39,558 --> 00:27:41,225
   Nick: Feel free to dance     
   to the music, by the way.    

740
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,026
         [upbeat music]         

741
00:27:42,061 --> 00:27:43,293
         On the inside,         

742
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:45,396
we're waiting for the plasterers
       to do their thing.       

743
00:27:45,431 --> 00:27:46,397
        Look at them go.        

744
00:27:46,432 --> 00:27:48,999
  Magnificent, it's flying up.  

745
00:27:49,035 --> 00:27:51,101
     - It's manic in here,      
   absolutely manic in here.    

746
00:27:51,137 --> 00:27:52,369
    It's good luck, though.     

747
00:27:52,405 --> 00:27:54,204
     Man 2: What? It's mad.     

748
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,506
        Man 1: He's mad.        

749
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:57,775
      Nick: Nevertheless,       
      Chris is plowing on       

750
00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:01,445
     with making the floors     
      wheelchair friendly.      

751
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,415
 - Well, you've got the walls,  
   and a slight discrepancy,    

752
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:07,084
  so we need to self-level it   
  tonight, get everyone out,    

753
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:09,053
  so tomorrow we can carry on   
   with the plaster-boarding    

754
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,220
       and the skimming.        

755
00:28:10,256 --> 00:28:11,789
      That's all planned.       

756
00:28:11,824 --> 00:28:14,324
     Nick: And the reason       
  everyone's working so hard,   

757
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,826
     well, it's the family.     

758
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:18,829
    This house hasn't fitted    
   their needs for some time,   

759
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:21,065
   and that's especially hard   
        for Mum Rachel,         

760
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,634
       who feels trapped        
       in her own home.         

761
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:24,935
       What would people        
        not understand          

762
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:27,004
       about what you do        
     on a day-to-day basis?     

763
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,540
 How do you-- How do you cope?  

764
00:28:29,575 --> 00:28:31,809
 - The answer is I don't know.  

765
00:28:31,844 --> 00:28:34,011
     Every day with a child     
with special needs is just hard,

766
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:36,080
 even just gettin' him dressed, 

767
00:28:36,115 --> 00:28:38,782
     gettin' him in and out     
of his pram, puttin' him to bed,

768
00:28:38,818 --> 00:28:40,184
      he's on pain relief       
         all the time           

769
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:41,852
         because he has         
     a lot of muscle spasms     

770
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:44,855
 as part of his cerebral palsy. 

771
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:45,989
    He's got sleep disorder,    

772
00:28:46,025 --> 00:28:48,959
    so we have broken sleep     
         most nights,           

773
00:28:48,994 --> 00:28:50,127
       and that makes it        
     difficult to function.     

774
00:28:50,162 --> 00:28:51,528
   I always think if you get    
           in sleep,            

775
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:53,297
    you can pretty much cope    
         with anythin',         

776
00:28:53,332 --> 00:28:54,364
      that's become like,       
       the norm, really,        

777
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,600
   broken sleep every night.    

778
00:28:56,635 --> 00:28:57,701
         - Well, that's         

779
00:28:57,737 --> 00:28:58,802
   an internationally banned    
       form of torture.         

780
00:28:58,938 --> 00:28:59,570
            - Yeah.             

781
00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:01,872
    It's a-- I can see why.     

782
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:04,475
    - How do you think Andy     
        copes with it?          

783
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:08,112
- I always worry more about Andy
    than what I do about me.    

784
00:29:08,147 --> 00:29:11,048
 It's just put a massive strain 
 on our relationship together.  

785
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:13,617
   I always used to feel that   
nothing could sort of touch us, 

786
00:29:13,652 --> 00:29:16,653
 but as times sort of gone on,  
   it's just hard sometimes.    

787
00:29:16,689 --> 00:29:18,589
    I think Andy's struggled    
      a lot more than me,       

788
00:29:18,624 --> 00:29:19,890
         to be honest.          

789
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:21,625
        I know he feels         
        a lot of guilt.         

790
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,193
     His life hasn't really     
        sort of changed,        

791
00:29:23,229 --> 00:29:24,695
   he still goes out to work    
           every day            

792
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:26,997
whereas I'm at home-- the need--

793
00:29:27,032 --> 00:29:29,767
           He worries           
        about me a lot.         

794
00:29:29,802 --> 00:29:32,136
   - Would it be fair to say    
   it's been wearing you out?   

795
00:29:32,171 --> 00:29:33,237
           - I feel--           

796
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:35,539
 I feel pretty wrung out, to be 
      honest, just lately.      

797
00:29:35,574 --> 00:29:37,775
       I do have my days        
 when I could just sit and cry. 

798
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:39,910
     It could just sort of      
 come over me all of a sudden.  

799
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:41,645
      If I was to actually      
         start cryin',          

800
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,913
        properly cryin',        
       I would be worried       

801
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:45,449
that I wouldn't be able to stop.

802
00:29:45,484 --> 00:29:49,353
   - You could see every day    
   what Isaac gets from you,    

803
00:29:49,388 --> 00:29:51,288
  what do you get from Isaac?   

804
00:29:51,323 --> 00:29:52,656
         - Just the joy         
     from seeing him laugh,     

805
00:29:52,691 --> 00:29:56,160
   the fact that he can show    
   pleasure for things and--    

806
00:29:56,195 --> 00:29:57,494
 it's just-- it's just amazin'. 

807
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:01,298
    Every single day is like    
 the first time you've seen it. 

808
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:05,035
           [laughing]           

809
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:07,037
      But even if a doctor      
     categorically told me      

810
00:30:07,072 --> 00:30:10,007
  he's never going to do this,  
     I think, as a parent,      

811
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:11,475
       you've still got         
     that fighting spirit,      

812
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:12,676
    that well, no, actually,    

813
00:30:12,711 --> 00:30:13,544
        he might be able        
        to do something,        

814
00:30:13,579 --> 00:30:16,146
       you never do know.       

815
00:30:16,182 --> 00:30:17,481
    There's always got a bit    
        of a hope there,        

816
00:30:17,516 --> 00:30:21,251
      and I suppose that's      
  what keeps us going, really.  

817
00:30:21,287 --> 00:30:25,789
         [happy sounds]

        [birds tweeting]        

819
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:32,329
    Nick: Well, we might be     
      2,500 man hours in,       

820
00:30:32,364 --> 00:30:35,165
        but this place          
     is far from finished,      

821
00:30:35,201 --> 00:30:36,266
       and Mark knows it.       

822
00:30:36,302 --> 00:30:39,102
           [beeping]            

823
00:30:39,138 --> 00:30:40,771
      Mark: Where do you        
    want to be today, then?     

824
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:42,339
         Man: The pub?          

825
00:30:42,374 --> 00:30:43,674
   Mark: Really, where do you   
        want to be here?        

826
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:47,778
- I want this circle feature in,
just to prove that it does work,

827
00:30:47,813 --> 00:30:50,013
    so when Nick comes back,    
       he can say sorry.        

828
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:51,148
        - Is that Nick,         
      the garden designer,      

829
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,516
    or Nick the electrician?    

830
00:30:52,551 --> 00:30:53,450
       - Nick the oracle.       

831
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:54,952
- Nick the oracle, right, okay. 

832
00:30:54,987 --> 00:30:57,855
        - So we can say         
         we were right.         

833
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,423
    Nick: I'm not accustomed    
    to sticking my nose in,     

834
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:02,626
but I will say getting 10 tonnes
       of hard-core down        

835
00:31:02,661 --> 00:31:05,529
         in four hours          
   is asking the impossible.    

836
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:08,232
          [whistling]           

837
00:31:08,267 --> 00:31:08,765
          - That's it.          

838
00:31:08,801 --> 00:31:10,367
      [continue whistling]      

839
00:31:10,402 --> 00:31:12,469
        Nick: But there         
    is no escaping this job.    

840
00:31:16,909 --> 00:31:17,708
        Mark: If that's         
       all done tonight,        

841
00:31:17,743 --> 00:31:19,543
I'm going to pull my pants down 

842
00:31:19,578 --> 00:31:21,979
    and run down the garden     
     with my bare bum out.      

843
00:31:22,014 --> 00:31:23,513
   Nick: Yeah, please don't.    

844
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:25,115
     You know who I blame?      

845
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:27,217
      Kendell, that's who.      

846
00:31:27,253 --> 00:31:28,218
   - It's going to get done,    
           honestly.            

847
00:31:28,254 --> 00:31:29,786
          Have faith.           

848
00:31:29,822 --> 00:31:30,921
     The guys are already--     

849
00:31:30,956 --> 00:31:32,356
      do you see how many       
      there are out there?      

850
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:33,957
     - Yes, and they're all     
  looking at each other going,  

851
00:31:33,993 --> 00:31:35,259
            "Help!"             

852
00:31:35,294 --> 00:31:37,494
              See?              

853
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:38,996
         Irrespective           
     of the garden issues,      

854
00:31:39,031 --> 00:31:40,230
      we've got a schedule      
          to stick to,          

855
00:31:40,266 --> 00:31:44,534
   so the kitchen's arrived     
and joiners are joining things, 

856
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,737
         but the inside         
       isn't quite ready.       

857
00:31:46,772 --> 00:31:48,772
   However, they are smiling.   

858
00:31:48,807 --> 00:31:49,640
      - Are we all happy?       

859
00:31:49,675 --> 00:31:50,908
           All: Yeah.           

860
00:31:50,943 --> 00:31:51,875
    - And they're all happy,    

861
00:31:51,977 --> 00:31:53,176
Look, I didn't have to give them
           any money.           

862
00:31:53,212 --> 00:31:55,045
   Look at that, cup of tea,    
          on the go,            

863
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,413
     whilst travelling up.      

864
00:31:56,448 --> 00:31:57,481
        See, he's happy!        

865
00:31:57,516 --> 00:31:58,615
             Look!              

866
00:31:58,651 --> 00:31:59,850
  Nick: Chris's boys have now   
   happily worked their way     

867
00:31:59,885 --> 00:32:02,953
   over virtually every piece   
     of board in the place,     

868
00:32:02,988 --> 00:32:04,321
       that's every wall        
         and ceiling.           

869
00:32:04,356 --> 00:32:05,355
 Man: Another hour and a half.  

870
00:32:05,391 --> 00:32:07,124
         Skimming this          
     and this 'round here,      

871
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:08,859
    and then we'll be done.     

872
00:32:08,894 --> 00:32:09,893
   Nick: The old living room    
           is gone.             

873
00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:10,961
          In its place          

874
00:32:10,996 --> 00:32:14,998
   is a wheelchair-accessible   
     bedroom and wet room.      

875
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:16,733
     - It needs to come up.     

876
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:18,135
       Nick: Whilst we're       
        making it easier        

877
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:20,037
     to get into the house      
     with widened doorways      

878
00:32:20,072 --> 00:32:21,638
   and a new flattened curb.    

879
00:32:21,674 --> 00:32:24,007
           [drilling]           

880
00:32:24,043 --> 00:32:25,075
         There are no           
      half measures here,       

881
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,476
          which means           
  a phenomenal amount of work,  

882
00:32:26,512 --> 00:32:30,714
  so Billy is boosting morale.  

883
00:32:30,749 --> 00:32:34,284
     - My granddaughter's       
   got a pet mouse, and it--    

884
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,620
 it died, I got the phone call, 
           it's died.           

885
00:32:36,655 --> 00:32:38,021
      It was called Elvis.      

886
00:32:38,057 --> 00:32:40,324
    It was caught in a trap.    

887
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:41,091
          It's a joke.          

888
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:42,926
           [laughing]           

889
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:44,127
         Nick: I think          
     I preferred him angry.     

890
00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:45,896
           [laughing]           

891
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,335
       - That's the last        
       bit of plastering.       

892
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:52,302
      Have you enjoyed it?      

893
00:32:52,338 --> 00:32:52,970
       - Yes, every bit.        

894
00:32:53,005 --> 00:32:54,438
            - Yeah.             

895
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:56,640
   - Yeah, I'd be here for a    
      bloomin' six weeks,       

896
00:32:56,675 --> 00:32:58,542
doing this by meself, normally. 

897
00:32:58,577 --> 00:32:59,743
       It's a good crack.       

898
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:02,412
     Throw the boys at it,      
    and they've got it done.    

899
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:11,388
   Nick: Okay, just four days   
       left in the build.       

900
00:33:11,423 --> 00:33:12,322
    Normally at this stage,     

901
00:33:12,358 --> 00:33:13,857
       we'd have broken         
    the back of the garden,     

902
00:33:13,892 --> 00:33:16,093
      but this job looks        
    like it might break us.     

903
00:33:16,128 --> 00:33:17,394
         The thing is,          

904
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:20,564
  we simply can't ask any more  
  of the people working on it.  

905
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:21,832
        - Very suddenly,        

906
00:33:21,867 --> 00:33:25,035
we've got to put a gentle rocket
up the posterior of the garden. 

907
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,703
    - Of the garden, right.     

908
00:33:26,739 --> 00:33:28,939
 Nick: You can't ask any more!  

909
00:33:29,008 --> 00:33:29,906
     - It's a very big job.     

910
00:33:29,942 --> 00:33:32,743
       It's a lot bigger        
    than what we was hopin'.    

911
00:33:32,778 --> 00:33:35,712
     Nick: Yes, and I said      
   the design wouldn't help.    

912
00:33:35,748 --> 00:33:37,881
We've been trying to cut circles
      out of square timber      

913
00:33:37,916 --> 00:33:39,216
    for the past five days,     

914
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:40,884
     and it's nowhere near      
           finished.            

915
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:42,252
     I warned you, I said.      

916
00:33:42,421 --> 00:33:44,588
    Man: Needs round posting    
   all the way, innit, that.    

917
00:33:44,623 --> 00:33:45,722
          Both sides.           

918
00:33:45,758 --> 00:33:47,357
            - Yeah.             

919
00:33:47,393 --> 00:33:48,959
 Yeah, that'll do it, won't it? 

920
00:33:48,994 --> 00:33:50,761
   - It will be a lot easier,   
          wouldn't it?          

921
00:33:50,796 --> 00:33:53,397
     Nick: Finally, a voice     
     of reason, thank you.      

922
00:33:56,502 --> 00:33:59,770
         - That's more          
      like, [indistinct].       

923
00:33:59,805 --> 00:34:00,771
     Nick: This is getting      
      ridiculous, we're--       

924
00:34:00,806 --> 00:34:02,773
        we're not going         
        to finish this,         

925
00:34:02,808 --> 00:34:03,940
       it doesn't matter        
    what the designers say.     

926
00:34:03,976 --> 00:34:05,042
      There's come a point      
     where we've got to go,     

927
00:34:05,077 --> 00:34:06,443
   that's it, that's enough.    

928
00:34:06,478 --> 00:34:07,577
      Whatever we've got,       

929
00:34:07,613 --> 00:34:09,846
      we just have to lawn      
   the rest of it and finish.   

930
00:34:09,882 --> 00:34:12,349
     - Well, let's give it      
until 3 o'clock this afternoon, 

931
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:14,017
    'cause we've got a lot      
  of extra people turning up,   

932
00:34:14,053 --> 00:34:16,753
     and if they turn up,       
   we'll get a good push on,    

933
00:34:16,789 --> 00:34:18,255
  and then we'll call it at 3.  

934
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:19,122
       Is that all right?       

935
00:34:19,158 --> 00:34:20,157
         - Fair enough.         

936
00:34:20,192 --> 00:34:21,758
         So, the garden         
       is in the balance,       

937
00:34:21,794 --> 00:34:23,527
     but at least the house     
    is looking less wrecked,    

938
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:28,398
   which means the decorators   
  get to splash on some color.  

939
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:29,966
             - Ooh!             

940
00:34:30,002 --> 00:34:31,701
      Nick: Just realized       
        she's on telly.         

941
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:33,370
   Woman: Well, it's gonna be   
    to the wire, I suppose,     

942
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:35,972
      uh, everybody knows       
what they're doing, don't they? 

943
00:34:36,008 --> 00:34:37,407
We're used to a bit of pressure.

944
00:34:37,443 --> 00:34:39,843
  Nick: The decorators aren't   
 the only team under pressure.  

945
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:42,279
     The joiners have a lot     
        on their plate.         

946
00:34:42,314 --> 00:34:44,815
       Julia's design has       
     space-saving cupboards     

947
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:47,150
and a fabulous new kitchen area.

948
00:34:47,186 --> 00:34:48,318
     - Looking good, innit?     

949
00:34:48,353 --> 00:34:49,653
       Nick: Yes, it is.        

950
00:34:49,688 --> 00:34:50,654
     - Can't wait to see it     
          all finished          

951
00:34:50,689 --> 00:34:52,122
         and everyone's         
         out of the way         

952
00:34:52,157 --> 00:34:54,157
   and when it gets presented   
      back to the family.       

953
00:34:54,193 --> 00:34:56,159
 Nick: Yeah, that's something   
 we're all looking forward to.  

954
00:34:56,195 --> 00:34:58,128
      Every single member       
        of this family          

955
00:34:58,163 --> 00:35:02,732
       has been affected        
     by Isaac's condition.      

956
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:05,235
     When Isaac was born,       
     Connie was only four,      

957
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:09,239
        and his illness         
    had a big impact on her.    

958
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:12,109
 Connie loves to draw pictures  
     of the whole family,       

959
00:35:12,144 --> 00:35:15,078
     so Julia has asked her     
      to create something       

960
00:35:15,114 --> 00:35:17,380
      just for the house.       

961
00:35:17,416 --> 00:35:20,317
 - I found these really lovely, 
      and little pennants,      

962
00:35:20,352 --> 00:35:21,318
 and I thought what we could do 

963
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:23,653
          is paint one          
  for everybody in the family.  

964
00:35:23,689 --> 00:35:26,523
  Shall I do one for your dad,  
             maybe?             

965
00:35:26,558 --> 00:35:27,691
            - Mm...             

966
00:35:27,726 --> 00:35:30,494
       you'll have to put       
 quite a lot of football on it. 

967
00:35:30,529 --> 00:35:32,195
   - Football on it, will I?    

968
00:35:32,231 --> 00:35:33,430
     - Forest and football.     

969
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:37,767
 - Right, okay, so off you go,  
        then, sweetie.          

970
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:39,536
          - I'm doing           
      a bit of a dinosaur,      

971
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:41,605
 'cause Isaac likes creatures.  

972
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,839
            - Yeah?             

973
00:35:42,875 --> 00:35:45,242
         That's lovely.         

974
00:35:45,277 --> 00:35:47,711
     So what's it been like     
         up until now,          

975
00:35:47,746 --> 00:35:49,746
       until we got ahold       
         of the house?          

976
00:35:49,781 --> 00:35:51,815
       - Uh, it's been--        

977
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:54,951
     it's been a bit tricky     
         for everyone,          

978
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:57,354
       especially my mum.       

979
00:35:57,389 --> 00:35:59,823
   And my sister's a monkey,    
     so it's even harder.       

980
00:35:59,858 --> 00:36:02,926
  - [laughing] She's a monkey,  
           she-- aw.            

981
00:36:02,961 --> 00:36:05,795
     - And I'm going to put     
       some smiley faces,       

982
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:08,098
         'cause Isaac's         
        always giggling.        

983
00:36:08,133 --> 00:36:09,432
    - He is always giggling,    
           isn't he?            

984
00:36:09,468 --> 00:36:10,400
       I've noticed that.       

985
00:36:10,435 --> 00:36:11,902
   He seems very, very happy.   

986
00:36:11,937 --> 00:36:13,303
      It wasn't like that       
   in the beginning, was it,    

987
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:15,839
       when he was born?        

988
00:36:15,874 --> 00:36:18,475
      - Much better now,        
   but he still cries a bit.    

989
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:21,678
  - So, do you think that when  
  Isaac's got his own bedroom,  

990
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:24,147
         that is going          
      to make him happier?      

991
00:36:24,183 --> 00:36:26,583
             Yeah?              

992
00:36:26,618 --> 00:36:27,884
         That's lovely.         

993
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,719
      You can have a nice,      
        big smiley face.        

994
00:36:29,755 --> 00:36:31,488
              Yay.              

995
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:32,689
        That's fabulous.        

996
00:36:32,724 --> 00:36:36,693
 I think he's gonna love that.  

997
00:36:36,728 --> 00:36:38,094
     Nick: I think so too.      

998
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:39,429
       Back at the house,       

999
00:36:39,464 --> 00:36:42,332
 and the garden isn't where it  
needs to be at this late stage. 

1000
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:45,168
 But we have got extra people,  
    and they brought gifts.     

1001
00:36:45,204 --> 00:36:47,304
  Uh, can I guess from the van  

1002
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:48,338
   that you've got a hot tub    
            for us?             

1003
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:49,573
             - Yes.             

1004
00:36:49,608 --> 00:36:50,373
          - Is it big?          

1005
00:36:50,409 --> 00:36:51,408
        - Yeah. Massive.        

1006
00:36:51,443 --> 00:36:53,243
       Nick: Look at the        
         ridiculous--           

1007
00:36:53,278 --> 00:36:54,311
        that's not going        
       to go in the shed.       

1008
00:36:54,346 --> 00:36:56,079
      - Oh, yes, it will.       

1009
00:36:56,114 --> 00:37:00,417
     It's all been designed     
  for the size of the hot tub.  

1010
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:02,485
     It is-- I don't know       
   what they were expecting.    

1011
00:37:02,521 --> 00:37:04,988
   You know, it is a hot tub,   
        it's not a bath.        

1012
00:37:05,023 --> 00:37:06,289
     And frankly, you know,     

1013
00:37:06,325 --> 00:37:10,961
  of course all of the family   
  are going to want to use it.  

1014
00:37:10,996 --> 00:37:12,796
        You're not going        
  to expect the other children  

1015
00:37:12,831 --> 00:37:14,364
to stand by and watch, are they?

1016
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:15,832
    I mean, how ridiculous.     

1017
00:37:15,867 --> 00:37:18,134
     Nick: Release the tub.     

1018
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:19,669
- See, I told you it would fit. 

1019
00:37:19,705 --> 00:37:22,305
    - Yeah, no, it does fit,    
          it does fit.          

1020
00:37:22,341 --> 00:37:29,579
        Mark: Up! And...        

1021
00:37:29,615 --> 00:37:31,314
        Man: How's that?        

1022
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:32,482
            - Nice.             

1023
00:37:32,517 --> 00:37:34,050
          Nice, ah...           

1024
00:37:34,086 --> 00:37:37,053
     Nick: More realistic.      

1025
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:40,123
   Okay, I'll give her that,    
  she can get a tub in a shed.  

1026
00:37:40,158 --> 00:37:41,958
        But this design         
    is becoming my nemesis.     

1027
00:37:41,994 --> 00:37:42,959
          It's crazy.           

1028
00:37:42,995 --> 00:37:44,661
     We're on version three     
        of the circles,         

1029
00:37:44,696 --> 00:37:46,796
       and all the posts        
   need individually cutting    

1030
00:37:46,832 --> 00:37:48,498
          and placing.          

1031
00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:53,503
      - [playing a fanfare      
      on a pretend bugle]       

1032
00:37:53,538 --> 00:37:55,005
         The last post.         

1033
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,307
   [laughing] The last post!    

1034
00:37:57,342 --> 00:37:59,909
    Nick: That's very good,     
           actually.            

1035
00:37:59,945 --> 00:38:03,346
    With only two days left,    
    it's now decision time.     

1036
00:38:03,382 --> 00:38:06,049
   We said that at 3 o'clock    
     we would take a view       

1037
00:38:06,084 --> 00:38:07,784
        of where we are         
       with this garden.        

1038
00:38:07,886 --> 00:38:09,119
    Are we now at a position    
        where we can say        

1039
00:38:09,154 --> 00:38:10,086
       that we can stick        
       with this design,        

1040
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:13,923
         or do we have          
      to cut holes in it?       

1041
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:15,125
        - Stick with it.        

1042
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,326
   - You reckon we've got it    
   back under control today?    

1043
00:38:16,361 --> 00:38:17,294
         - Yeah, just.          

1044
00:38:17,329 --> 00:38:20,230
Just-- really, really happening.

1045
00:38:20,265 --> 00:38:21,965
       - Well done you,         
  'cause this has been your--   

1046
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,566
  Can I interrupt your brownie  
  just for a second, 'cause--   

1047
00:38:23,602 --> 00:38:24,734
     - It's not a brownie.      

1048
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:28,438
     It's actually tiffin,      
 and it's really, really nice.  

1049
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:29,439
        - I don't care          
        how nice it is,         

1050
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:32,075
  I'm trying to interview you   
       for the program,         

1051
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:35,445
  and you're sat there chewing  
   away like a milching cow.    

1052
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,647
  - It's almost finished now.   

1053
00:38:37,683 --> 00:38:38,882
       - Well, the gard--       

1054
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:40,884
      are we still talking      
about the garden, or the tiffin?

1055
00:38:40,919 --> 00:38:42,252
           - Tiffin.            

1056
00:38:42,287 --> 00:38:43,753
        - Unbelievable.         

1057
00:38:43,789 --> 00:38:44,654
         In the house,          

1058
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:46,156
       the guys are busy        
      installing equipment      

1059
00:38:46,191 --> 00:38:48,992
     that should make life      
         much easier.           

1060
00:38:49,027 --> 00:38:50,126
  A new top-of-the-range hoist  

1061
00:38:50,162 --> 00:38:51,761
        will mean Isaac         
      can move comfortably      

1062
00:38:51,797 --> 00:38:55,832
        from his bedroom        
    through to his wet room.    

1063
00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:57,200
      - A bit of grouting       
       going on in here,        

1064
00:38:57,235 --> 00:38:59,703
       it's very lovely,        
add a nice finish on the tiles. 

1065
00:38:59,738 --> 00:39:00,804
         The boys, uh,          

1066
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:04,407
fixing one of these all-singing,
      all-dancing toilets.      

1067
00:39:04,443 --> 00:39:05,775
           Fantastic.           

1068
00:39:05,811 --> 00:39:09,079
      With so many trades,      
    all in at the same time,    

1069
00:39:09,114 --> 00:39:12,248
      things can go wrong.      

1070
00:39:12,284 --> 00:39:15,385
       - Yeah, not good.        

1071
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,953
    - What's happened here?     

1072
00:39:16,988 --> 00:39:19,055
      Oh, that's not good.      

1073
00:39:19,091 --> 00:39:20,190
        - Uh, plaster's         
      comin' off the wall.      

1074
00:39:20,225 --> 00:39:21,291
          That's bad.           

1075
00:39:21,326 --> 00:39:22,292
    That's unusual, in fact.    

1076
00:39:22,327 --> 00:39:23,460
          In the rush           
      to get things done,       

1077
00:39:23,495 --> 00:39:24,394
  we've ripped some wallpaper   

1078
00:39:24,429 --> 00:39:26,029
    and tried to replace it     
        with a new bit.         

1079
00:39:26,064 --> 00:39:28,698
        But the plaster         
     has come away with it.     

1080
00:39:28,734 --> 00:39:29,733
         Sixteen years,         

1081
00:39:29,768 --> 00:39:32,602
   first time I've ever seen    
    a plastering disaster.      

1082
00:39:32,637 --> 00:39:33,570
     - It's not a disaster.     

1083
00:39:33,605 --> 00:39:34,437
         - Well it's--          

1084
00:39:34,473 --> 00:39:35,305
    it's come off the wall,     
         Chris, right,          

1085
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,539
  I'd say that was a disaster.  

1086
00:39:36,575 --> 00:39:38,942
  - What was the disaster was   
 the chipping of the wallpaper. 

1087
00:39:38,977 --> 00:39:40,477

      wallpaper over here,      

1111
00:40:17,649 --> 00:40:19,282
  we're just introducing some   
       texture and color.       

1112

    Wait, it will be lovely.

 But it's gonna take a bit more 
        than just trust         

1115

Well, at least it's not raining.

   I'm not convinced, though,   
      what I'm being told,      

1120
00:40:36,201 --> 00:40:38,835

    a beautiful environment

   still two days' work here,   

1125
00:40:44,843 --> 00:40:45,809
   which is a bit of a worry,   

1126
00:40:45,844 --> 00:40:46,743
        because we have         
   to finish tomorrow night.

  We've only got one day left.  

1128

   But then, what do I know?    

1129
00:40:49,481 --> 00:40:52,182
We'll find out whether I'm right
   or they're right tomorrow.

   Overnight, we've received    
        some bad news.          

1133
00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:03,426
         Isaac has been         
      rushed into hospital      

1134
00:41:03,462 --> 00:41:06,029
         with seizures          
  and breathing difficulties.   

1135
00:41:09,401 --> 00:41:13,436
       He is now stable,        
 but will stay in with Dad Andy 

1136
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:16,673
       while Mum Rachel         
  looks after the other kids.   

1137
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:18,808
     It's times like this       
  I'm reminded of the worries   

1138
00:41:18,844 --> 00:41:22,612
this family must face every day.

1139
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:23,847
     Rachel: Since Isaac's      
          diagnosis,            

1140
00:41:23,882 --> 00:41:26,850

 we'd ever have to go through.  

1142

we may or may not have with him.

1143
00:41:36,194 --> 00:41:37,527
     You don't think that--     

1144
00:41:37,562 --> 00:41:41,898
   I mean, that your children   
    are gonna go before you.    

1145
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:44,567
  I worry about Isaac, because  
    he's just so vulnerable,    

1146
00:41:44,603 --> 00:41:47,270
 because he can't tell anybody  
        what he wants.          

1147
00:41:47,305 --> 00:41:51,875
   I try to-- I try to stay     
  positive a lot of the time,   

1148
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:52,775
      and just try to hope      

1149
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:58,815
      that he will be able      
       to do some things.       

1150
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,383
      It's scary to think       
        that he might--         

1151
00:42:00,418 --> 00:42:06,022
 he might never know who I am.

      It scares me that--

00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,028
well, that not only will he not 
know who I am, but he'll never--

1154

     he'll never be able--      

1155
00:42:13,932 --> 00:42:15,732
      he'll never be able       
to run to me, give me a cuddle, 

1156
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:21,437
      he'll never be able       
       to say, "Mummy."

to fight for life from day one, 

1158
00:42:24,943 --> 00:42:28,144
   but his strength continues   
    to surprise both medics     

1159
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:32,582
  and those who love him most.

1162

   with that fight every day,

1206
00:44:12,851 --> 00:44:16,319
  Julia's design aims to ease   
    the family's situation,     

1207
00:44:16,354 --> 00:44:21,024
  but right now, it's put in    
 the thumb screws on this lot.  

1208
00:44:21,059 --> 00:44:22,125
      - I've been laying        
     this artificial grass      

1209
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,693
    for the past six years.     

1210
00:44:23,728 --> 00:44:25,828
  This is the most difficult,   
         intricate job          

1211
00:44:25,864 --> 00:44:27,263
      that I've done yet.       

1212
00:44:27,298 --> 00:44:29,932
 Nick: Yeah, sorry about that.  

1213
00:44:29,968 --> 00:44:32,568
             Julia!             

1214
00:44:32,604 --> 00:44:34,437
 Finding it stressful, are we?  

1215
00:44:34,472 --> 00:44:37,807
 - We've got to be out of here  
 in about ten minutes, I think. 

1216
00:44:37,876 --> 00:44:39,575
 We're under a bit of pressure, 
         to be honest.          

1217
00:44:39,611 --> 00:44:41,411
   - If you don't need to be    
         in the house,          

1218
00:44:41,446 --> 00:44:42,745
    don't go into the house.    

1219
00:44:46,251 --> 00:44:47,183
          - Good job.           

1220
00:44:47,218 --> 00:44:48,885
    - The green grass is not    
      going to your house.      

1221
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,787
           [laughing]           

1222
00:44:50,822 --> 00:44:53,356
      Nick: But as we rush      
      to the finish line,       

1223
00:44:53,391 --> 00:44:55,858
 I can't wait to hand it back.  

1224
00:44:55,894 --> 00:44:56,926
           [clinking]           

1225
00:44:56,961 --> 00:44:57,860
        Eight hours ago,        

1226
00:44:57,896 --> 00:44:59,729
      I said this garden        
     wouldn't be finished.      

1227
00:44:59,764 --> 00:45:01,197
    And I was wrong, it is.     

1228
00:45:01,232 --> 00:45:02,231
  But we can't show it to you   
        at this point,          

1229
00:45:02,267 --> 00:45:03,933
     we're not allowed to.      

1230
00:45:03,968 --> 00:45:06,502
      Go on, just a quick       
      sneaky peek, then.        

1231
00:45:06,538 --> 00:45:08,237
         That's enough!         

1232
00:45:08,273 --> 00:45:11,441
       It's good, innit?        

1233
00:45:12,277 --> 00:45:13,409
      Just nine days ago,       

1234
00:45:13,445 --> 00:45:16,145
       we arrived to find       
      a family in despair,      

1235
00:45:16,181 --> 00:45:17,747
     struggling day to day      
        with everything         

1236
00:45:17,782 --> 00:45:21,117
     from sleep deprivation     
     to leaving the house.      

1237
00:45:21,152 --> 00:45:22,051
   - It literally just feels    

1238
00:45:22,087 --> 00:45:24,921
    like the walls are just     
       closin' in on me.        

1239
00:45:24,956 --> 00:45:26,522
     Nick: With a severely      
         disabled son           

1240
00:45:26,558 --> 00:45:28,524
      needing special care      
       around the clock,        

1241
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,561
 their home was claustrophobic  
   and working against them.    

1242
00:45:31,596 --> 00:45:32,595
       Andy: I've worried       
        that the stress         

1243
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:35,264
       is going to reach        
        breaking point.         

1244
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:38,134
Nick: At a time when they needed
to be strong and come together, 

1245
00:45:38,169 --> 00:45:40,937
     the house was forcing      
       everybody apart.         

1246
00:45:40,972 --> 00:45:44,273
     Connie: 'Cause Isaac's     
       got special needs,       

1247
00:45:44,309 --> 00:45:47,410
         Daddy's always         
      sleeping downstairs.      

1248
00:45:47,445 --> 00:45:51,481
        Nick: Something         
        had to be done.         

1249
00:45:51,516 --> 00:45:53,216
     Look, it's busy, look.     

1250
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:54,250
          [chuckling]           

1251
00:45:54,285 --> 00:45:57,120
    We sent out an S.O.S.,      
   and Derbyshire responded.    

1252
00:45:57,155 --> 00:46:00,823
      Heroes, every single      
          one of them.          

1253
00:46:00,859 --> 00:46:06,028
       Just take a look,        
      what they've built.       

1254
00:46:06,064 --> 00:46:07,930
          At the front          
      there is a new drive      

1255
00:46:07,966 --> 00:46:11,334
  and wheelchair-friendly ramp  
      and widened doorways      

1256
00:46:11,369 --> 00:46:14,303
       so Rachel and Andy       
   no longer have to struggle   

1257
00:46:14,339 --> 00:46:17,940
       to get in and out        
       of their own home.       

1258
00:46:17,976 --> 00:46:20,042
Inside, the old cramped kitchen 
           is gone,             

1259
00:46:20,078 --> 00:46:22,812
and I have to say Julia's design
        is magnificent,         

1260
00:46:22,847 --> 00:46:28,384
       with a new kitchen       
  and a fantastic dining area.  

1261
00:46:28,419 --> 00:46:29,685
 And, at the back of the house, 

1262
00:46:29,721 --> 00:46:33,556
   we've extended out to make   
  a comfortable family lounge,  

1263
00:46:33,591 --> 00:46:37,894
        something they          
      were desperate for.       

1264
00:46:37,929 --> 00:46:38,961
      The old living room,      

1265
00:46:38,997 --> 00:46:42,565
         which doubled          
 as Dad's bedroom, is no more.  

1266
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:43,666
   In its place, we've built    

1267
00:46:43,701 --> 00:46:47,003
  a brand-new stylish bedroom   
    and wet room for Isaac,     

1268
00:46:47,038 --> 00:46:50,106
        all-easy access         
  with the equipment he needs,  

1269
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:55,111
         without ever           
       looking clinical.        

1270
00:46:55,146 --> 00:46:56,879
    Upstairs, we've widened     
         the hallway,           

1271
00:46:56,915 --> 00:46:59,282
     making the whole area      
      feel less cramped,        

1272
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:04,120
         and redesigned         
      the family bathroom.      

1273
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:07,824
  Violet's room and Connie's    
  room have been transformed.   

1274
00:47:07,859 --> 00:47:10,092
      Now they are spaces       
        to be proud of,         

1275
00:47:10,128 --> 00:47:17,533
       bright and girly         
   and worthy of sleepovers.    

1276
00:47:17,569 --> 00:47:18,634
And finally, Mum and Dad's room.

1277
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:20,670
       A fully integrated       
       monitoring system        

1278
00:47:20,705 --> 00:47:22,538
 connects with Isaac's bedroom, 

1279
00:47:22,574 --> 00:47:23,873
  meaning that Rachel and Andy  

1280
00:47:23,908 --> 00:47:28,277
   can finally get some rest    
          in comfort.           

1281
00:47:28,313 --> 00:47:29,312
      And that's not all.       

1282
00:47:29,347 --> 00:47:31,347
 The garden, once inaccessible  

1283
00:47:31,382 --> 00:47:34,183
        to a little boy         
     reliant on his senses,     

1284
00:47:34,219 --> 00:47:38,454
      is now breathtaking.      

1285
00:47:38,489 --> 00:47:41,057
     Julia's circular paths     
    are bordered with plants    

1286
00:47:41,092 --> 00:47:44,760
  that will appeal to Isaac's   
  hearing and sense of smell,   

1287
00:47:44,796 --> 00:47:46,362
  leading to the therapy hut,   

1288
00:47:46,397 --> 00:47:49,098
   where he can have regular    
    hydro therapy sessions      

1289
00:47:49,133 --> 00:47:51,968
 to help with his development.  

1290
00:47:52,003 --> 00:47:53,870
 85 construction workers a day  
       have been working        

1291
00:47:53,905 --> 00:47:56,172
      to try and give you       
      the house you need.       

1292
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:59,642
      So, open your eyes.       

1293
00:47:59,677 --> 00:48:03,646
            [gasps]             

1294
00:48:03,681 --> 00:48:05,481
            - Oh my.            

1295
00:48:05,516 --> 00:48:09,051
   Rachel: It's just amazin'.   

1296
00:48:09,087 --> 00:48:14,023
   - Oh. This is incredible.    

1297
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:15,958
     Absolutely incredible.     

1298
00:48:15,994 --> 00:48:16,659
       Rachel: I love it.       

1299
00:48:16,694 --> 00:48:19,362
      Absolutely love it.       

1300
00:48:19,397 --> 00:48:21,764
 Andy: Can we get to live here? 

1301
00:48:21,799 --> 00:48:25,601
              Oh.               

1302
00:48:25,637 --> 00:48:27,236
   Nick: I want to draw your    
  attention to the middle one,  

1303
00:48:27,272 --> 00:48:29,939
    the face that's Connie's    
       painted for Isaac.       

1304
00:48:29,974 --> 00:48:30,940
      - Oh, he's smilin'.       

1305
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:33,209
          - His smile.          

1306
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:34,310
    - She always draws him--    

1307
00:48:34,345 --> 00:48:35,811
  she always draws him smiling  
    when he was first born,     

1308
00:48:35,847 --> 00:48:37,713
          didn't she?           

1309
00:48:37,749 --> 00:48:40,216
   Andy: Oh, that's amazin'.    

1310
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:41,150
       Nick: Have a look.       

1311
00:48:41,185 --> 00:48:42,385
 Rachel: I love all the colors. 

1312
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,787
She couldn't have got the colors
     any better, could she?     

1313
00:48:44,822 --> 00:48:46,989
        I just love it,         
      I just love it all.       

1314
00:48:47,025 --> 00:48:48,491
     It's so-- it's just--      

1315
00:48:48,526 --> 00:48:49,825
      - How lucky are we.       

1316
00:48:49,861 --> 00:48:51,227
      - It's just amazin'.      

1317
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:52,862
     Andy: It's incredible.     

1318
00:48:52,897 --> 00:48:56,032
     It's so overwhelmin'.      

1319
00:48:56,067 --> 00:48:58,334
    - Look at our pictures.     

1320
00:48:58,369 --> 00:49:00,770
  It's just beyond the wildest  
     dreams, to be honest.      

1321
00:49:00,805 --> 00:49:01,971
     Nick: Well, we've only     
         just started.          

1322
00:49:02,006 --> 00:49:03,773
       There's a lot more       
          to show you.          

1323
00:49:03,808 --> 00:49:04,473
            - Okay.             

1324
00:49:04,509 --> 00:49:05,608
  - Ready to come have a look?  

1325
00:49:05,643 --> 00:49:06,542
         - I think so.          

1326

00:49:29,834 --> 00:49:33,035
        it doesn't look

    like a little boy's bed.

  and a little bit of a choice

      - It just doesn't--

  such a difference, won't it?

   are seein', to be honest.

you're getting a look-in.

      a big worry of mine,

    - Can you see the future    
       being better now?        

1386
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:55,077
